            "Hillary Reboots \u2018Vast Right-Wing Conspiracy\u2019 Playbook 10/31/2016 \r\nLIFEZETTE \r\nBefore even 24 hours had passed since the FBI director informed Congress on Friday that it was reopening the probe into Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails, Clinton suggested the director was in cahoots with the Republican Party. \r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made it very clear that, if they are going to be sending this kind of letter that is only going originally to Republican members of the House, that they need to share whatever facts they claim to have with the American people,\u201d Clinton said on Friday, after initially being blindsided by the FBI\u2019s announcement. \r\nThe claim wasn\u2019t true. All you had to do is turn the page and find Democratic members of Congress who had also received the letter from the FBI. But it shows how ready Clinton is to fight anyone in the government who dares investigate or question her. It is likely a habit Clinton picked up when she was first lady, from 1993 to 2001. \r\nClinton\u2019s opening salvo, though weak, is a sign of more to come. Her coming attack on the FBI and its director, James Comey, will likely begin in earnest on Monday, with her operatives using the letter to Congress as proof Clinton is the victim of a political conspiracy. \r\nClinton previewed her attack in Daytona Beach, Florida, on Saturday, when she said the letter was \u201cunprecedented and deeply troubling.\u201d \r\nClinton will also turn the issue into one of \u201ctransparency\u201d \u2014 even though FBI investigations are inherently not transparent. In Daytona, she called on Comey to \u201cexplain everything right away, put it all right on the table\u201d \u2014 a demand she knows will go unheeded. \r\nBut many of Clinton\u2019s allies in the media are likely to demand to see the emails found on former Rep. Anthony Weiner\u2019s laptop. \r\nIt\u2019s a strategy that could work, even with only a few days left until Election Day. \r\nSuch attacks on law enforcement worked fairly well for Clinton in 1998, when she and her husband, then-President Bill Clinton, vilified independent counsel Kenneth Starr. Starr had been tasked by Bill Clinton\u2019s own attorney general to investigate corruption charges, but likely rued the day he ever took the job. \r\nIn 1994, Bill Clinton faced questions from many, including The New York Times, about an investment the Clintons made in a company called Whitewater Development Corp. Bill Clinton\u2019s attorney general, Janet Reno, made Robert Fiske the independent counsel. \r\nFiske would later be replaced by Starr. Starr\u2019s investigation would later reach into charges that President Clinton had lied in the Paula Jones sexual harassment civil trial. With explosive charges being published by the Drudge Report and Newsweek in January 1998 that Bill Clinton had seduced an intern, Monica Lewinsky, the Clintons could have been expected to admit the truth and take the punishments. \r\nInstead, the Clinton White House and the Democrats began attacking Starr and the Republicans. \r\nOn Jan. 27, 1998, Hillary Clinton went on NBC\u2019s \u201cThe Today Show\u201d and goaded the press into covering the opposition rather than President Bill Clinton, who had lied about his affair with Lewinsky just one day earlier. \r\nMatt Lauer asked if Hillary Clinton had said the fight against Starr would be the \u201clast great battle\u201d of the Clinton White House. \r\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve been that dramatic,\u201d Hillary Clinton replied. \u201cBut I do believe that this is a battle. I mean, look at the very people who are involved in this \u2014 they have popped up in other settings. This is \u2014 the great story here for anybody willing to find it and write about it and explain it is this vast right-wing conspiracy that has been conspiring against my husband since the day he announced for president.\u201d \r\nThe Starr report on the Clinton scandals was released months later. But what the Clintons are really proud of that is that the Democrats actually gained seats in the 1998 midterm elections, helping to cause a backfire against the GOP. \r\nThe GOP didn\u2019t have anywhere near the two-thirds majority in the Senate to remove Bill Clinton. In early 1999, the U.S. Senate acquitted Bill Clinton on two charges: obstruction of justice, and perjury. \r\nIt taught the Clintons the wrong lesson: to fight authorities if authorities questioned them \u2014 even authorities within the Democratic Party. Clinton will be targeting and attacking President Obama\u2019s own FBI director as Obama leaves office."

            "Email \r\nThe alleged connection between Donald Trump and Russia \u2014 asserted by Hillary Clinton in both the second and third presidential debates as a dodge for the leaked e-mails and other documents which have hounded her candidacy \u2014 has dominated much of the speculative attention of both the mainstream media and social media for weeks. Is there anything to it? Is Trump, in essence, Putin\u2019s puppet, as Clinton claimed in the third debate? \r\nIn an interesting twist of logic (if one can use that word to describe the incoherent and dissonant arguments made by a woman who still denies \u2014 despite mountains of evidence to the contrary \u2014 that she sent and received classified data over her unsecured, private e-mail server), Hillary Clinton at once claims that Russia is responsible for the hack of the servers of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) in late spring and that there is no way her server was hacked by anyone. Leveraging the anti-Russian sentiment to its fullest, she and others in the DNC have sought to shift the focus away from what was on the servers and toward blaming Russia for the hack. After all, if Russia is trying to throw the election to Trump, wouldn\u2019t the patriotic vote be for Clinton? \r\nBy the time WikiLeaks announced that a trove of damning documents and e-mails would be published on the Internet, Clinton and the DNC (along with their lapdog media) were already in full-blown \"it was Russia\" mode. On the same day that a video of Donald Trump emerged in which he can be heard bragging of his sexual abuse of women \u2014 which he has since claimed was just \u201clocker room talk\u201d \u2014 WikiLeaks began a rolling release of the promised leaked documents. Both of these stories deserved media attention . Only one got it. \r\nBy the time the media was ready to report anything on the WikiLeaks dump, it was to speculate as to what part Russia played in the initial hack. Clinton \u2014 in her role as the staunch anti-Russian \u2014 used the timing of the second debate to attack Trump for the video and his supposed ties to Russia, which she plainly blamed for the leaked documents, saying to moderator Martha Raddatz: But, you know, let\u2019s talk about what\u2019s really going on here, Martha, because our intelligence community just came out and said in the last few days that the Kremlin, meaning Putin and the Russian government, are directing the attacks, the hacking on American accounts to influence our election. And WikiLeaks is part of that, as are other sites where the Russians hack information, we don\u2019t even know if it\u2019s accurate information, and then they put it out. We have never in the history of our country been in a situation where an adversary, a foreign power, is working so hard to influence the outcome of the election. And believe me, they\u2019re not doing it to get me elected. They\u2019re doing it to try to influence the election for Donald Trump. \r\nClinton went even further in the third debate , bringing up Putin in an attempt to dodge a question about a leaked document showing that she gave a speech to a foreign bank in which she said, \u201cMy dream is a hemispheric common market with open trade and open borders.\u201d She \u2014 again \u2014 put the emphasis on the fact that WikiLeaks was providing the leaked documents rather than on what the leaked documents have to say. Then she claimed, on the authority of \u201c17 of our intelligence agencies,\u201d that Russia was behind the hacked and leaked documents: But you are very clearly quoting from WikiLeaks. And what\u2019s really important about WikiLeaks is that the Russian government has engaged in espionage against Americans. They have hacked American websites, American accounts of private people, of institutions. Then they have given that information to WikiLeaks for the purpose of putting it on the Internet. This has come from the highest levels of the Russian government, clearly, from Putin himself, in an effort, as 17 of our intelligence agencies have confirmed, to influence our election. \r\nTrump rebutted by bringing the conversation back on topic (not his usual strongest point), saying: She wants open borders. People are going to pour into our country. People are going to come in from Syria. She wants 550 percent more people than Barack Obama, and he has thousands and thousands of people. They have no idea where they come from. And you see, we are going to stop radical Islamic terrorism in this country. She won\u2019t even mention the words, and neither will President Obama. So I just want to tell you, she wants open borders. Now we can talk about Putin. I don\u2019t know Putin. He said nice things about me. If we got along well, that would be good. If Russia and the United States got along well and went after ISIS, that would be good. He has no respect for her. He has no respect for our president. And I\u2019ll tell you what: We\u2019re in very serious trouble, because we have a country with tremendous numbers of nuclear warheads \u2014 1,800, by the way \u2014 where they expanded and we didn\u2019t, 1,800 nuclear warheads. And she\u2019s playing chicken. Look, Putin... \r\nAt this point, Clinton interrupted to say, \u201cWell, that\u2019s because he\u2019d rather have a puppet as president of the United States.\u201d \r\nSo, getting past the he-said-she-said, what are the facts as we know them? \r\nOn Monday, the New York Times reported that after conducting a months-long \u201cinvestigation into a Russian role in the American presidential campaign\u201d in which \u201cagents scrutinized advisers close to Donald J. Trump, looked for financial connections with Russian financial figures, searched for those involved in hacking the computers of Democrats, and even chased a lead \u2014 which they ultimately came to doubt \u2014 about a possible secret channel of email communication from the Trump Organization to a Russian bank,\u201d the FBI \u201csees no clear link\u201d between Trump and Russia. Of course, in typical leftist fashion, the Times not-so-gently insinuates that the FBI is guilty of pulling punches in the investigation. Interestingly, the Times seemed to miss that that is exactly what happened in the FBI's investigation into Clinton's e-mail server. \r\nAs for Clinton\u2019s claims that the purpose of the hacked and leaked documents and e-mails was to influence the election for Trump, the Times article admits: Law enforcement officials say that none of the investigations so far have found any conclusive or direct link between Mr. Trump and the Russian government. And even the hacking into Democratic emails, F.B.I. and intelligence officials now believe, was aimed at disrupting the presidential election rather than electing Mr. Trump. \r\nAlso on Monday, Slate published an article claiming that a server belonging to Donald Trump was \u201ccommunicating in a secretive fashion\u201d with servers in Russia. By the next day, the Washington Post had debunked the Slate article, saying, \u201cThat secret Trump-Russia email server link is likely neither secret nor a Trump-Russia link.\u201d Based in part on an interview with Naadir Jeewa, who \u201cdoes consulting work on precisely the sorts of systems involved in\u201d the scenario involving the server Slate claims was acting as a conduit between Trump and Russia, the article by the Post explains: To understand what's likely happening, we need to establish a few basics. First of all, the Trump server wasn't really a Trump server. It was much less of a Trump email server, for example, than Hillary Clinton's email server was hers. Clinton had a physical server that hosted her email. The trump-email.com domain that Alfa was connecting to was hosted by a company called Cendyn. Cendyn runs marketing systems for the hospitality industry, meaning that it offers an out-of-the-box solution for a company that owns a bunch of hotels to push out sales pitch emails to its customers. In other words, trump-email.com isn't the email server Trump used to send emails from his closet. It was a domain name that linked back to a Cendyn server. This is important for a few reasons. The first, Jeewa said, was that the trump-email.com was configured to reject a certain type of query from another server. Since its job was simply to push out thousands of enticements to come stay at Trump Soho (or whatever) it didn't need to receive many incoming requests (like incoming email). The second is that the conspiracy theory hinges on Trump's team using an offsite server hosted by someone else for its quiet communications with its Russian allies. Instead of, say, their own server, under their own control. Or an encrypted chat app. Or a phone call. \r\nThis writer has to admit to being amused to see the shoe on the other foot (or the tinfoil hat on the other head, in this instance) as the Left trots out wild conspiracy theories to create a Trump-Putin connection to make Clinton retroactively correct. In point of fact, Clinton might be better off trying to implicate Trump in the Kennedy assassination. \r\nBut, what about Clinton\u2019s assertion that WikiLeaks is releasing documents pilfered by Russia for the sake of influencing the election for Trump? Aside from the FBI saying that there does not appear to be any attempt to influence the election for Trump, Julian Assange, the founder and public face of WikiLeaks, denies that Russian hackers are his source. \r\nIn an upcoming documentary made by Dartmouth Films, Assange speaks of the \u201cClinton camp\u201d putting forth a \u201chysteria that Russia is responsible for everything.\u201d He goes on to say, \u201cHillary Clinton has stated multiple times, falsely, that 17 US intelligence agencies had assessed that Russia was the source of our publications. That\u2019s false \u2014 we can say that the Russian government is not the source.\u201d \r\nFurthermore, the Kremlin denies Clinton\u2019s claims. Russian presidential press secretary Dmitry Peskov called the claims \u201cnonsense.\u201d While that \u2014 in and of itself \u2014 would not carry much weight, when it is added to the body of evidence that includes Assange denying the Russian connection, the laughably far-fetched lengths to which the Left will got to promote easily debunkable conspiracy theories, the FBI stating that there is \u201cno clear link\u201d between Trump and Russia, and Trump himself denying that he has any dealings with Russia, it\u2019s fairly easy to see that the only thing there is to see here is an imploding campaign by the woman who \u2014 the last time she occupied 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue \u2014 claimed that her husband\u2019s impeachment was the result of a \u201cvast right-wing conspiracy.\u201d \r\nSome things never change.

            "FBI officials say their investigation into links between US Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and Russia has been unable to uncover any so far, according to the New York Times.\r\nThe bureau has been trying to find evidence showing that the Russian government is trying to influence the US presidential campaign since the beginning of summer. FBI agents have put advisers close to GOP candidate Donald Trump under close scrutiny, searching for financial connections that some have alleged exist between the nominee and Russian financial figures. They even followed up on a lead hinting that there had been a secret email correspondence between Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Organization and Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Alfa-bank. All the while, the bureau has been searching for the hackers that breached the computers of the Democratic camp and leaked emails that became the source of many scandals damaging to Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s campaign.\r\nNonetheless, the FBI still cannot say that any of its investigations have uncovered direct links between Trump and Russian authorities, the New York Times reported on Monday, citing recent interviews and its own bureau sources.\r\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153No evidence has emerged that would link [Trump] or anyone else in his business or political circle directly to Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election operations,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d writes the NYT.\r\nOfficials also anonymously told the NYT that whoever the hackers were, the attacks were aimed at disrupting the presidential race on the whole, and not boosting Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chances of getting into the Oval Office, as the Western media and Democrats have been claiming.\r\nIn explaining why Russia would want to interfere in the campaign, one senior official was cited as saying, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t about the election\u00e2\u20ac\u015a It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s about a threat to democracy.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\r\nThe FBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inquiries will continue, however. In interviews over the past several weeks, intelligence officials have signaled that they have opened a larger probe to look into suspicions over connections between Trump aides and Moscow.\r\nIn the most recent lead, an anonymous computer scientist going by the name Tea Leaves found some 2,700 \u00e2\u20ac\u0153look-up\u00e2\u20ac\u009d messages that tied a server being used by one of Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s companies to those of Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Alfa Bank.\r\nStill, the FBI found that there was no two-way communication, and these messages could have been marketing emails or spam. Both the Trump campaign and Alfa Bank issued statements denying that they had been in communication.\r\n\r\nThe FBI is also probing Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, whose foreign business and political dealings have come under scrutiny since reports surfaced claiming he was involved with a pro-Russian political party in Ukraine, NBC reported, citing intelligence sources.\r\n\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcRussia hacking\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 vs Clinton emails \r\nA separate report from CNBC citing a former FBI official claims that the bureau\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s director, James Comey, was privately reluctant about naming Russia as the entity responsible for meddling in the US election campaign, reportedly saying it was too close to the November 8 Election Day.\r\nIn the beginning of October, Comey allegedly concluded that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a foreign power was trying to undermine the election,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d but arguing against putting it out before the election itself.\r\nHe also allegedly made sure that the Federal Bureau of Investigation was not mentioned in the document compiled by the US government on October 7, which officially accused Russia of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153authorizing\u00e2\u20ac\u009d the hacking of emails accounts of US officials and organizations, out of concern that the FBI would be seen as interfering with the election if it was included.\r\nHowever, last Friday, with the election mere days away, Comey announced that the bureau was reopening its investigation into Hillary Clinton because several hundred thousand new emails that may be related to the private server used by the Democratic nominee had allegedly been discovered.\r\nThe announcement, which left many in the government puzzled, has already resulted in official complaints and attacks from the entire US political spectrum. On Monday, some 100 former federal prosecutors and senior Department of Justice officials, including Attorney General Eric Holder, signed a letter expressing concern over Comey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to reopen the case \u00e2\u20ac\u0153on the eve of a major election,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the mere disclosure of information may impact the election\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s outcome\u00e2\u20ac\u009d at this stage.\r\nClinton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s supporters have accused Comey of deliberately hiding \u00e2\u20ac\u0153explosive\u00e2\u20ac\u009d information about Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s alleged ties to Russia, demanding that he discuss them publicly, just as he did with the new batch of Clinton-related emails.\r\nHillary Clinton and her supporters have repeatedly criticized Trump for praising Russian President Vladimir Putin, while Trump has retorted that he has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153nothing to do\u00e2\u20ac\u009d with Russia and doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know its leader personally.\r\nPutin on accusations of meddling: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcrubbish\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 \r\nRussia, in turn, has denied having any links to the Trump camp on numerous occasions, while refuting accusations that it had been behind the hacking attacks on the Democrats, with Russian President Vladimir Putin calling them \u00e2\u20ac\u0153rubbish\u00e2\u20ac\u009d last week.\r\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The image [that Russia supports a candidate in the US presidential election] was created by the media,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Putin said at the Valdai Discussion Club in Sochi last Thursday, stressing that this had been done deliberately.\r\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is complete and utter rubbish, and it is just a method of internal political struggle, as well as a way of manipulating the public consciousness ahead of the US presidential elections,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d he added, while explaining that Russia does not prefer any particular candidate and is ready to work with either of them. Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president also stressed that friendly words and intentions to normalize relations between the US and Russia are always welcome, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153whoever expresses them.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\r\nSource"

            "The letter from FBI Director Comey announcing the reopening of the Clinton email investigation is already being blown up into more than it is. \r\nHere is the letter via CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper: FBI Dir Comey letter to congressional committee chairs re discovery of \"new emails\u2026pertinent to the investigation\" pic.twitter.com/y4gvHiILLn \r\n\u2014 Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) October 28, 2016 \r\nAs Republicans cheer because they think that they have been thrown an election lifeline, read the whole letter and look at what it says. The letter does not say that Hillary Clinton did anything wrong. The letter states that emails were found that were pertinent to the email investigation while looking into an unrelated matter. \r\nThe letter FBI Director Comey reads like what it is, an update on an investigation. The FBI is dotting the Is and crossing the Ts. Comey\u2019s letter destroys the Republican claim that there was a conspiracy to cover up Clinton\u2019s emails. Republicans, including Donald Trump, have spent months criticizing Comey\u2019s investigation, but it turns out that they were wrong. \r\nIt would take something unprecedented and dramatic to change the FBI\u2019s original findings. Director Comey made it clear that the agency\u2019s work might not be completed before the election. \r\nThe email story that Republicans and the media love, but voters have never cared about is back in the news, but it remains an empty scandal. \r\nThe FBI\u2019s reopened investigation does open the door for Republicans to continue their bogus witch hunt if Hillary Clinton wins the White House. Unless voters want two more years of conspiracy investigations instead of action, today\u2019s developments have made voting for Democrats in House and Senate contests more vital than ever."

            "Now Hillary Makes Conspiracy Theory Credible: 50% Believe   28, 2016 \r\nHalf Of Americans Believe 9/11 Conspiracy Theories \u2026 \u201cThe United States is a strongly conspiratorial society.\u201d \u2026 A majority of Americans believe that the government is concealing information about the 9/11 attacks, one new survey suggests. And that\u2019s not the only conspiracy theory believed by a wide swath of Americans: Around 40 percent believe the government is hiding information about aliens, the John F. Kennedy assassination and global warming. \u2013 The Huffington Post \r\nBefore, those who believed in 9/11 conspiracy theories hovered around 20-30 percent according to the mainstream media. Now it\u2019s up to 50 percent, according to this article. \r\nHell, it\u2019s probably more like 60-70 percent anyway. There is perhaps a hard core of 30 percent of people living in the US who will likely never acknowledge anything wrong with the system or people in power. \r\nBut for most citizens, we\u2019ve long suggested the current election is destroying the credibility of the ruling classes and their facilities. \r\nWhatever in government that was supposed to be credible, from the IRS, to the FBI, to the Justice Dept., Congress and the presidency itself, has been visibly damaged by Hillary\u2019s election campaign. \r\nYou\u2019d have to be virtually blind \u2013 or a staunch partisan of a mythical \u201cUSA\u201d\u2013 not to notice that the Democratic front-runner has committed actions for which anyone else would have been significantly punished. \r\nAnd not just Hillary of course but those surrounding her including Bill Clinton and the Foundation that allows them to trade political favors for cash. \r\nThen there\u2019s the mainstream media. The media has investigated little or none of the malfeasance and worse (murders?) surrounding the Clintons, and thus newspapers, magazines and TV, already deprived of viewers and ad revenue, have been further damaged by an obvious, ongoing lack of credibility. \r\nMore: \r\nConspiracy theories about the JFK assassination abound, and scientists say these ideas have become embedded in the very culture surrounding his death, with heaps of TV shows, books and movies on them. \r\n\u201cWe found clear evidence that the United States is a strongly conspiratorial society,\u201d study lead author Christopher Bader, a sociologist at Chapman University in California, said in a statement. \r\nIn order to denigrate suspicion of the government, the study suggests that people\u2019s views regarding conspiracies have to do with their own emotional makeup. In other words, \u201cparanoid\u201d people believe in \u201cconspiracies.\u201d \r\nThis canard worked better when the number of those voicing conspiracy theories was in the single digits, according to surveys. When half or more than half of the public begins to believe in them, something else is going on. \r\nNeither the article nor the study (presumably) acknowledges that the CIA came up with the idea of calling people \u201cconspiracy theorists\u201d if they advance theories that the US government is corrupt and secretly tyrannical. \r\nThe conduct of this past campaign and the Clinton\u2019s evident criminality has reinforced all that is wrong with the US in the views of many and, additionally, has made it clear that even the deepest suspicions of how the US operates are justified. \r\nWe can come away with two realizations from this. \r\nThe first is that despite Hillary\u2019s possible election, the US as a valid and valuable entity is shattered in the eyes of many. This is actually a good development in our view given that the US (and its British controllers) has not been positive for freedom or peace in the world at least since the end of the Civil War. \r\nThe second conclusion, which is not a popular one but which we have voiced before, is that the disaffection of the American public was SUPPOSED to be heightened by the Hillary campaign. \r\nThe idea here is that chaos and paranoia is supposed to be endlessly increased until the US, like other nation-states, virtually shatters and more aggressive globalism can be introduced in the wake of the disintegration. \r\nWestern nation-states currently have strong cultures. These cultures need to be torn down if true globalization is to be introduced. \r\nThe banking elites of this world, mostly located in the City of London, are determined to introduce this chaos, it seems. In Europe chaos is mounting thanks to the introduction of the artificial \u201cimmigration crisis.\u201d \r\nIn the US, Hillary has served in the place of immigration, cracking the US culture as thoroughly as millions of young Muslim males. Next on the agenda? Possible economic collapse and \u201cworld-war\u201d style military activities. \r\nConclusion: Yes, it sounds grim \u2026 and even conspiratorial. But there is much you can do to secure your safety and prosperity \u2013 and that of your family\u2019s and even your community\u2019s. You have to realize the civil society you believe in is vanishing (or never existed). And you have to act."

            "Posted 10/31/2016 3:17 pm by PatriotRising with 0 comments Democratic strategist calls reopened Clinton probe an \u2018attack\u2019 on American democracy in MSNBC tantrum \r\nFamed Democratic strategist James Carville may be the first Clinton surrogate to have officially lost his mind over the FBI\u2019s decision to reopen its investigation into Clinton\u2019s private email server. \r\n\r\nIn an appearance on MSNBC on Monday, Carville relentlessly \u2014 and repeatedly \u2014 attacked the FBI\u2019s decision to reopen the investigation into Hillary Clinton, asserting it is part of a conspiracy to subvert American democracy. \r\n\r\n\u201cThis is in effect an attempt to hijack an election,\u201d Carville claimed. \u201cIt\u2019s unprecedented \u2026 the House Republicans and the KGB are trying to influence our democracy,\u201d he said. \r\n\r\nApparently the fact that the Soviet security agency was disbanded in 1991 does not preclude its involvement in this vast, anti-Clinton conspiracy organized by the FBI, according to Carville. Poor Carville was clearly apoplectic at the news of Comey\u2019s announcement, describing it as an assault or attack on American democracy multiple times. \r\n\r\nHe was also adamant about who was responsible. \u201cComey was acting in concert and coordination with the House Republicans,\u201d Carville said. \u201cWe also have the extraordinary case of the KGB being involved in this race and selectively leaking things from the Clinton campaign that they hacked,\u201d he claimed. \r\nCarville was very upset that Comey\u2019s announcement thrust Clinton\u2019s surely unethical and likely illegal behavior back into the spotlight. \u201cIt would seem to me that the FBI shouldn\u2019t be getting rolled by the House Republicans, that\u2019s what happened here \u2014 there\u2019s nothing else that\u2019s going on \u2014 and in the meantime \u2026 democracy is under assault by the KGB,\u201d he said. \u201cTo me that\u2019s something we ought to be talking about.\u201d \r\n\r\nUnfortunately for Carville, whilst fanciful tales about time-traveling Soviet spies and an FBI on the GOP\u2019s take certainly make for interesting entertainment, they pale in importance to the real life stories of Clinton\u2019s brazen lawlessness. \r\nWhen the MSNBC anchor dared raise the fact that Democrats were praising Comey only a few months ago when he announced the FBI\u2019s decision not to recommend indictment, Carville went into a stuttering, sputtering fit. Hillary Reboots \u2018Vast Right-Wing Conspiracy\u2019 Playbook Clinton camp set to wage effort to discredit FBI Director Comey and criminal probe as politically motivated \r\n\r\n\u201cWhen the facts change I change my mind,\u201d Carville said. \u201cWhy are you defending this, why are you sitting here as American democracy is under assault?\u201d he asked angrily. Faced with the Democrats\u2019 clear double standard \r\n\r\n\u201cThis is an unprecedented event that was done on behalf of the House Republicans,\u201d Carville repeated. \u201cAnd as we know the KGB is all over this election and this is what we are talking about? We ought to be talking about our democracy is under assault right now and what we are going to do about it, not [what somebody said in July] about James Comey.\u201d"

            "Print \r\nHmm, how about that? Eleven days before the game-changing 2016 presidential election, FBI Director James Comey announces that his agency is reopening the criminal investigation of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton . \r\nAll of the expected angst and apoplexy from the Left come gushing out. An anti-Trump PAC issues a complaint against the FBI for interfering with the eletoral process . Better still, the Clinton campaign issues a statement via \u2014 of all people \u2014 its chairman, John Podesta. In it, Podesta accuses Comey of bending to presure brought by \u201cDonald Trump and his Republican allies\u201d regarding the director\u2019s initial determination that no indictment against the former secretary of state should be brought. \r\nPodesta\u2019s prepared remarks also paraphrase Comey\u2019s declaration in July that \u201cno reasonable prosecutor would move forward with a case like this,\u201d which at the time prompted much head-scratching since he also affirmed that Clinton had indeed sent and received classified information using her non-secured private email account . \r\nCall me a conspiracy theorist if you like \u2014 my colleague Benny Huang probably would \u2014 but I have to wonder whether all this is too convenient. Could we be witnessing a calculated plan to divert attention from the WikiLeaks emails, which have been hurting the Democratic candidate\u2019s standing in the polls? This development might even gain some sympathy for Hillary Clinton, who has long maintained the vast right-wing conspiracy \u2014 which, nota bene, includes James Comey \u2014 has it out for the Clintons. \r\nOr better yet, suppose that the FBI does put a rush on its investigation, as Clinton herself has now demanded, and determines for a second time that there are no grounds for an indictment. \r\nAll the while, the press and impressionable voters would be focused on this probe. Envelope, please !"

            "Posted on November 1, 2016 by Dr. Eowyn | 2 Comments \r\nFor Hillary Clinton and her accomplice and protector, the Obama administration, Russia is the new, all-purpose bogeyman. \r\nThey say the Russian government is the hacker of those revealing and embarrassing DNC, Hillary and Podesta emails that WikiLeaks has been releasing. \r\nHillary even accused Donald Trump of being in cahoots with Moscow. The latest accuser is longtime Democratic strategist James Carville. \r\nAs reported by Edund Kozak for PoliZette , in an appearance on MSNBC yesterday, Oct. 31, 2016, Carville attacked the FBI for reopening its criminal investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails, calling it part of a vast conspiracy to subvert American democracy. (See \u201c Weinered: FBI reopens investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails \u201d) \r\nCarville raged: \r\n\u201cThis is in effect an attempt to hijack an election. It\u2019s unprecedented \u2026 the House Republicans and the KGB are trying to influence our democracy! [FBI Director James] Comey was acting in concert and coordination with the House Republicans. We also have the extraordinary case of the KGB being involved in this race and selectively leaking things from the Clinton campaign that they hacked.\u201d \r\nAs noted by Kozak, \u201cApparently the fact that the Soviet security agency [KGB] was disbanded in 1991 does not preclude its involvement in this vast, anti-Clinton, FBI-organized conspiracy.\u201d \r\nNow, the New York Times reports (via ZeroHedge ) that in an investigation into Russia\u2019s possible involvement in the 2016 presidential election, the FBI concludes that there\u2019s no evidence that Trump is connected with the Russian government: \r\n\u201cFor much of the summer, the F.B.I. pursued a widening investigation into a Russian role in the American presidential campaign. Agents scrutinized advisers close to Donald J. Trump, looked for financial connections with Russian financial figures, searched for those involved in hacking the computers of Democrats, and even chased a lead \u2014 which they ultimately came to doubt \u2014 about a possible secret channel of email communication from the Trump Organization to a Russian bank. \r\nLaw enforcement officials say that none of the investigations so far have found any link between Mr. Trump and the Russian government. And even the hacking into Democratic emails, F.B.I. and intelligence officials now believe, was aimed at disrupting the presidential election rather than electing Mr. Trump.\u201d \r\nHey, James Carville, you conniving POS. This message is for you! \r\n~Eowyn"

            "By Gordon Duff, Senior Editor on November 1, 2016 By Gordon Duff, Senior Editor and Ian Greenhalgh, Managing Editor \r\nJohn F. Kennedy memorably stated that he was going to smash the CIA into \u2018a thousand pieces\u2019, he had very good reasons for doing so; half a century later, it can reasonably be assumed that similar phrases are being darkly muttered within the corridors of power about the FBI. \r\nPresident George W. Bush \u201clost\u201d 22 million emails, many involving criminal investigations, and the FBI has said nothing, though the emails involved the White House used an illegal private server owned by the Republican Party for official government business. \r\nThe FBI is out to get Hillary Clinton, it\u2019s not Director Comey, Obama put him in there to clean up the mess, they\u2019ve been after Obama for 8 years. The \u2018birther\u2019 hoax began, no we aren\u2019t kidding, inside the FBI \u2013 it was the FBI that originated the wild rumour that Hillary Clinton murdered Vince Foster and that President Obama is not only a Muslim but many in the FBI actually say he\u2019s the anti-christ. \r\nLegal Analyst Paul Callan of CNN just published the following: \r\nLately, the FBI, while acting without the customary supervision of the Justice Department, appears to be a runaway train on a collision course with the concept of fairness in next week\u2019s presidential election. Democratic Senator Harry Reid and former White House ethics counsel Richard Painter have accused FBI Director James Comey of violating the Hatch Act by illegally using his office to influence the election. While the claim of a Hatch Act violation is a stretch, the appointment of an independent prosecutor and the replacement of Comey are nonetheless urgently required, if not outright overdue. The tangled relationship between the Clintons and Attorney General Loretta Lynch should have prompted appointment of an independent special prosecutor long ago.. \r\nHere\u2019s what Callan knew but wasn\u2019t able to write. The same informants that went to Callan also came to us and what they had to say was frightening. Here is how it began; an FBI insurrection and this is the exact term used by sources deep inside the FBI cabal, an FBI insurrection against, Comey, Hillary Clinton and Obama can no longer be safely ignored. This is why Senator Harry Reid has called for a criminal investigation of the FBI for violation of the Hatch Act. \r\nThe FBI, and this isn\u2019t Comey, it is the rank and file, the insurrectionist rank and file, a very powerful organisation that includes case managers, deputy directors that run not only counter-terrorism but financial crimes as well have not only targeted what they see to be dangerous liberal and progressive leaders, including of course the American president, but have continually protected criminals from prosecution as well. Those they have protected, possibly including names like Adelson, Trump and Romney, are funding moves against the US government, moves against American foreign policy and may well actually be funding recognised terror organisations as well, we have been specifically told this by sources within the FBI. \r\nThis insurrectional group within the FBI, which we are told includes the majority of FBI agents, has little idea what they have gotten into, some are aware they are taking orders from the shadowy Federalist Society, that \u2018right-wing conspiracy\u2019 Hillary Clinton referred to so many years ago as trying to bring down her husband\u2019s presidency, but it goes deeper, it gets scarier; it isn\u2019t just \u2018birthers\u2019. \r\nThe public face of this is blocked court appointments and a government in paralysis, but it\u2019s far deeper and far more threatening, it all became possible when two branches of government fell under the control of organised crime. It took a five/four rigged Supreme Court and a rigged election in 2000, covered up by the FBI, to subvert for all times the independence of America\u2019s legislature. Rigged by Richard Mellon Scaife, funded by Sheldon Adelson, a cabal calling themselves \u2018Neocons\u2019, in reality a front for organised crime, reapportioned Congressional districts across the US in clear violation of equal protection provisions of the constitution and backed by five mob-controlled members of the Supreme Court, bolstered by vote flipping software from the CIA, control of the legislative/investigative branch of government was permanently placed in the hands of a minority, destroying any hope of separation of powers and undermining all constitutional protections. Any hope of Americans influencing their own destiny disappeared with a rigged legislature running endless witch hunts and a mob-controlled Supreme Court backing them up. \r\nMaking it worse, so much worse, was the creation of a massive security bureaucracy, the Department of Homeland Security, laws authorising torture and illegal surveillance and the destruction of the FBI. \r\nNo public scandal can be investigated, no regulation enforced, no-one is left to speak up, no-one is safe from illegal arrest and imprisonment, a nightmare from the pages of Kafka become reality, all this has become clear in the last few days. \r\nWhen a prominent US senator calls for the prosecution of America\u2019s national police force, is it perhaps time to take note? \r\nThere was a reason the constitution prohibited the creation of the national police force, just as the constitution prohibited the creation of a central bank; there is no mechanism capable of controlling a central bank, as the failures of the Federal Reserve board and a cursory study of American history since 1913 will establish. \r\nSimilarly, no provision was established within the constitution to regulate or oversee a national police force, it didn\u2019t take long for the FBI to become the Cheka within a short period after it\u2019s creation, J. Edgar Hoover, turned \u2018the bureau\u2019 into a monstrosity blackmailing politicians and cosying up to crime figures while Hoover\u2019s FBI chased \u2018commies\u2019 both real and imaginary, it protected not only the mafia but powerful international crime cartels as well, becoming the real \u2018Murder Inc.\u2019 Taxpayer financed strong-arm thugs supported by a disinformation campaign. \r\nHoover gained control of the press almost immediately, keeping files on his press enemies, threatening and blackmailing; some of this was to protect his own secrets \u2013 mob ties and his notorious penchant for sexual deviance, now long in the public domain, but it went further \u2013 it was all about power. \r\n\u2018Mary\u2019 Hoover liked to dress as a woman and was infamously covertly photographed along with his longtime companion and lover Clyde Tolson in flagrante delicto; those photographs came into the possession of mob kingpin Meyer Lansky, thus ensnaring Hoover, and by extension the entire FBI in a dangerous marriage with the mob. There is no evidence they ever got divorced, though from time to time the relationship may have been somewhat rocky. \r\nSimply put, given these facts, any sense of surprise at FBI misconduct or calls for investigating or even disbanding the FBI, should be no surprise to anyone. Nearly every current television series that features scenarios involving the FBI invariably focuses on FBI corruption, the FBI\u2019s illegal involvement in politics and gross incompetence. \r\nSit at a table and have lunch with the FBI, it can go one of two ways \u2013 you can have brilliant, dedicated and relentless law enforcement officers who complain about being shackled by a corrupt bureaucracy, or like as not, a pack of delusional nutcases mouthing wild conspiracy theories and ranting about dangerous liberals; neither group, though widely divergent, make a case for the survival of the FBI. Then when you realise the Dept. of Homeland Security is entirely composed of conspiracy nutcases and other agencies are worse, it becomes clear that Harry Reid\u2019s demand to clean up the FBI is far from enough."

            "Failed Investigations of JFK\u2019s Murder November 21, 2016 \r\nMore than a half century later, John F. Kennedy\u2019s assassination still resonates not only because of its historical importance but because the investigation was more a cover-up than a pursuit of truth, says researcher Gary Aguilar. \r\nBy Gary Aguilar \r\nNovember 22 marks the 53 rd anniversary of John F. Kennedy\u2019s assassination. If history is any guide, it\u2019s likely some mainstream outlet will commemorate that dark day with reassurances that the Warren Commission was right that Lee Harvey Oswald did it alone, and that most doubters, who have been in the majority since the mid-1960s, are randy conspiracy theorists. That is the essential message by one of the experts likely to be cited this year, attorney Howard Willens. President John F. Kennedy in the motorcade through Dallas shortly before his assassination on Nov. 22, 1963. (Photo credit: Walt Cisco, Dallas Morning News) \r\nOne of the few still-living Warren Commission staffers, Willens followed up his 2013 book, History Will Prove Us Right, with a spirited defense of the Commission in the summer, 2016 issue of the journal, The American Scholar , which he co-wrote with another Commission staffer, attorney Richard Mosk. The piece , \u201cThe Truth About Dallas, \u201d is a celebration of the work and conclusions of the original investigation. \r\nBut Willens\u2019s and Mosk\u2019s defense of the work of the Warren Commission they served on is more notable for what they omit from the official record than what they include. \u201cWhat the critics often forget or ignore,\u201d they write, \u201cis that since 1964, several government agencies have also looked at aspects of our work,\u201d (p. 59) as if the Church Committee and the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) had reviewed and applauded the Commission\u2019s work. \r\nIndeed, they did look at it. But rather than plaudits, they issued stinging rebukes, principally for the Commission\u2019s having been rolled by FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, and to a lesser extent, by the CIA and the Secret Service. \r\n\u201cIt must be said that the FBI generally exhausted its resources in confirming its case against Oswald as the lone assassin,\u201d the HSCA concluded, \u201ca case that Director J. Edgar Hoover, at least, seemed determined to make within 24 hours of the of the assassination.\u201d \r\nIn essence, the experienced investigators concluded that Hoover had divined the solution to the crime before starting the inquiry, and then his agents confirmed the boss\u2019s epiphany. The intimidated Warren Commission went right along. FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover \r\nAnd with good reason, only part of which Willens and Mosk tell. They admit that the \u201cFBI had originally opposed the creation of the Warren Commission\u201d and that Hoover \u201cordered investigations of commission staff members.\u201d But they don\u2019t tell that Hoover deployed one of his favorite dirty tricks to deal not only with support staffers, such as Willens and Mosk, but also with the commissioners themselves. \r\n\u201c[D]erogatory information pertaining to both Commission members and staff was brought to Mr. Hoover\u2019s attention,\u201d the Church Committee reported . (emphasis added) \r\nHoover\u2019s Spy \r\nWillens and Mosk also forgot to mention that Hoover had a personal spy on the Warren Commission, then Rep. Gerald Ford, who tattled on Commissioners who were (justifiably) skeptical of the Bureau\u2019s work. \r\n\u201cFord indicated he would keep me thoroughly advised as to the activities of the Commission,\u201d FBI Agent Cartha DeLoach wrote in a once secret memo. \u201cHe stated this would have to be done on a confidential basis, however he thought it should be done.\u201d Autopsy photo of President John F. Kennedy. \r\nAt the bottom of the memo, Hoover scrawled , \u201cWell handled.\u201d The success of Hoover\u2019s machinations was obvious to subsequent government investigators. (Ford, of course, later became President upon the resignation of Richard Nixon in 1974.) \r\nThe HSCA\u2019s chief counsel, Notre Dame Law Professor Robert Blakey, a criminal investigator and prosecutor with vastly better credentials than either Willens or Mosk, was impressed with neither the Commission\u2019s vigor nor its independence. \r\n\u201cWhat was significant,\u201d Blakey determined, \u201cwas the ability of the FBI to intimidate the Commission, in light of the Bureau\u2019s predisposition on the questions of Oswald\u2019s guilt and whether there had been a conspiracy. At a January 27 [1964] Commission meeting, there was another dialogue [among Warren Commissioners]: \r\n\u201cJohn McCloy: \u2018\u2026 the time is almost overdue for us to have a better perspective of the FBI investigation than we now have \u2026 We are so dependent on them for our facts \u2026 .\u2019 \r\n\u201cCommission counsel J. Lee Rankin: \u2018Part of our difficulty in regard to it is that they have no problem. They have decided that no one else is involved \u2026 .\u2019 \r\n\u201cSenator Richard Russell: \u2018They have tried the case and reached a verdict on every aspect.\u2019 \r\n\u201cSenator Hale Boggs: \u2018You have put your finger on it.\u2019 (Closed Warren Commission meeting.)\u201d [Blakey & Billings, Fatal Hour\u2013 The Assassination of President . See also: North, Act of Treason ] \r\nTestifying before the HSCA, the Warren Commission\u2019s chief counsel J. Lee Rankin shamefully admitted , \u201cWho could protest against what Mr. Hoover did back in those days?\u201d Apparently not President Lyndon Johnson\u2019s blue-ribbon commissioners. \r\nThe HSCA\u2019s Blakey also reported that \u201cWhen asked if he was satisfied with the (Commission\u2019s) investigation that led to the (no conspiracy) conclusion, Judge Burt Griffin (a Commission staff member) said he was not.\u201d [Blakey & Billings, Ibid.] \r\nAnd author Gus Russo reported that Judge Griffin also admitted, \u201cWe spent virtually no time investigating the possibility of conspiracy. I wish we had.\u201d [Russo, Live by the Sword ] \r\nClear Misgivings \r\nThus, despite their clear misgivings, the Commissioners bowed to the imperious FBI chief rather than conduct a thorough investigation. Notably, the Commission never once employed a rudimentary investigative tool . \u201cThe Commission,\u201d the HSCA reported, \u201cfailed to utilize the instruments of immunity from prosecution and prosecution for perjury with respect to witnesses whose veracity it doubted.\u201d [US Cong. House of Reps. Report of Comm. on Assassinations, 1979] Lee Harvey Oswald, the accused assassin of President John F. Kennedy. \r\nThis policy had serious repercussions when the Commission confronted two key issues: published claims that Lee Harvey Oswald had been an FBI informant, and the possibility that Jack Ruby was mobbed up. \r\n\u201cThe Commission did not investigate Hoover or the FBI, and managed to avoid the appearance of doing so,\u201d the HSCA determined . \u201cIt ended up doing what the members had agreed they would not do: Rely mainly on the FBI\u2019s denial of the allegations (that Oswald had been a Bureau informant).\u201d \r\nHoover merely sent the Commission his signed affidavit declaring that Oswald was not an informant and also \u201csent over 10 additional affidavits from each FBI agent who had had contact with Oswald.\u201d And with that, case closed. \r\nRegarding Jack Ruby, the FBI had his phone records, yet failed to spot Ruby\u2019s obvious, and atypical, pattern of calls to known Mafiosi in the weeks leading up to the assassination. After performing the simple, obvious task of actually analyzing those calls, the HSCA determined that, if not a sworn member of La Cosa Nostra, Ruby had ongoing, close links to numerous Mafiosi. \r\nThus the HSCA roundly rejected the Warren Commission\u2019s conclusion that, \u201cthe evidence does not establish a significant link between Ruby and organized crime.\u201d \r\nThe list of Warren Commission shortcomings that the HSCA assembled is not short. A brief summary of them runs some 47 pages in the Bantam Books version of the report (p. 289\u2013336), which outlines what required much of the 500 pages of HSCA volume XI to cover ( available on-line ). \r\n\u201cThe evidence indicates that facts which may have been relevant to, and would have substantially affected, the Warren Commission\u2019s investigation were not provided by the agencies (FBI and the CIA). Hence, the Warren Commission\u2019s findings may have been formulated without all of the relevant information.\u201d \r\nThe Church Committee said that the problem was that \u201cthe Commission was perceived as an adversary by both Hoover and senior FBI officials.\u201d \u201cSuch a relationship,\u201d the Committee dryly observed , \u201cwas not conductive to the cooperation necessary for a thorough and exhaustive investigation.\u201d \r\nBut the FBI did more than just withhold evidence from the Commission. Although they admit that the FBI destroyed a note Oswald wrote to Agent Hosty, and withheld that information from the Commission, Willens and Mosk don\u2019t mention that Agent Hosty reported that his own personnel file, and other FBI files, had been falsified. [Hosty, Jr. Assignment: Oswald ] \r\nNor that author Curt Gentry learned from assistant FBI director William Sullivan that there were other JFK documents at the Bureau that had been destroyed. [Gentry, J. Edgar Hoover\u2013 The Man and His Secrets ] \r\nPerhaps one of the reasons the public has remained mistrustful of the government\u2019s conclusions, and the mainstream media reassurances, is the sort of selective presentation of evidence by ax grinders like Willens and Mosk who get heralded by our \u201cresponsible\u201d media. \r\nGary Aguilar is one of the few physicians outside the government ever allowed to see the still-restricted JFK autopsy photos and X-rays. He has published and lectured on the topic of the JFK assassination for many years."

            "People over profits Dem Wingnut James Carville Melts Down, Says 'KGB' Controls FBI \r\nThe Democratic strategist calls reopened Clinton probe an 'attack' on American democracy in a MSNBC tantrum   PoliZette \r\nFamed Democratic strategist James Carville may be the first Clinton surrogate to have officially lost his mind over the FBI\u2019s decision to reopen its investigation into Clinton\u2019s private email server. \r\nIn an appearance on MSNBC on Monday, Carville relentlessly \u2014 and repeatedly \u2014 attacked the FBI\u2019s decision to reopen the investigation, asserting it is part of a conspiracy to subvert American democracy. \r\nApparently the fact that the Soviet security agency was disbanded in 1991 does not preclude its involvement in this vast, anti-Clinton, FBI-organized conspiracy, according to Carville. Poor Carville was clearly apoplectic at the news of Comey\u2019s announcement, describing it as an assault or attack on American democracy multiple times.\u201cThis is in effect an attempt to hijack an election,\u201d Carville claimed. \u201cIt\u2019s unprecedented \u2026 the House Republicans and the KGB are trying to influence our democracy,\u201d he said. \r\nHe was also adamant about who was responsible. \u201cComey was acting in concert and coordination with the House Republicans,\u201d Carville said. \u201cWe also have the extraordinary case of the KGB being involved in this race and selectively leaking things from the Clinton campaign that they hacked,\u201d he added. \r\nCarville was very upset that Comey's announcement thrust Clinton's behavior back into the spotlight. \"It would seem to me that the FBI shouldn't be getting rolled by the House Republicans, that's what happened here \u2014 there's nothing else that's going on \u2014 and in the meantime \u2026 democracy is under assault by the KGB,\" he said. \"To me that's something we ought to be talking about.\" \r\nUnfortunately for Carville, fanciful tales about time-traveling Soviet spies and an FBI in the GOP's pocket certainly make for interesting entertainment \u2014 but they pale in importance to the real-life stories of Clinton's brazen lawlessness. \r\nWhen the MSNBC anchor dared raise the fact that Democrats were praising Comey only a few months ago when he announced the FBI's decision not to recommend indictment, Carville went into a stuttering, sputtering fit. \r\n\"When the facts change I change my mind,\" Carville said. \"Why are you defending this, why are you sitting here as American democracy is under assault?\" he asked. \r\n\"This is an unprecedented event that was done on behalf of the House Republicans,\" Carville repeated. \"And as we know the KGB is all over this election and this is what we are talking about? We ought to be talking about [how] our democracy is under assault right now and what we are going to do about it, not [what somebody said in July] about James Comey.\""

            "How Hillary Clinton Poisoned American Politics Crazy conspiracy theories dominate the final days before Nov. 8 Share This \r\nFBI Director James Comey\u2019s decision to reopen the investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s mishandling of classified information has the Clintonites falling back on their tried-and-true response to all the revelations coming from WikiLeaks and other sources \u2013 it\u2019s all a Russian plot. Except, this time, the hysteria has reached such a fever pitch, and the conspiracy theories are so unhinged, that the political discourse in this country will be poisoned for years to come. \r\nIt started with Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio), who told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer: \r\n\u201cSo the question is: Where did these [emails] come from? How did they get to the FBI? Is Russia involved in this? We don\u2019t have a clue where this stuff is coming from.\u201d \r\nWe don\u2019t know if Ryan was drunk ( again ) when he said this, but his nickname of \u201c Congressman Moonbeam \u201d seems well-earned, and the implication of his remarks \u2013 that the FBI is in league with the Russians \u2013 underscores his marginality. However, it wasn\u2019t long before the marginal started merging with the mainstream. In tandem with Rya, Howard Dean, former presidential candidate and once head of the Democratic party, tweeted : \r\n\u201cIronically, Comey put himself on the same side as Putin.\u201d \r\nNow Dean may be a bit more credible than Ryan, but who can forget the \u201c Dean scream \u201d that dramatized his loonier side, and effectively knocked him out of contention for the Democratic presidential nomination? And then there were those payments from the Mujahideen-e-Khalq , a nutty Marxist-Islamist cult, in return for serving as their front man. And so while Dean may be better known, what he\u2019s know for isn\u2019t exactly adding to his credibility, and so we can safely relegate this kind of conspiracy theorizing to the fringes of the Democratic party spectrum. Right? \r\nWrong. Here is longtime Clintonite strategist James Carville opining that \u201cIt\u2019s unprecedented \u2026 the House Republicans and the KGB are trying to influence our democracy.\u201d Well, okay, who listens to Carville, anyway? He\u2019s so yester day! Well, then, get a load of Harry Reid, who leads the Senate\u2019s Democrats, repeating a different version of the same nonsense in a letter to Comey : \r\n\"In my communications with you and other top officials in the national security community, it has become clear that you possess explosive information about close ties and coordination between Donald Trump, his top advisors, and the Russian government \u2013 a foreign interest hostile to the united states, which Trump praises at every opportunity. The public has a right to know this information. I wrote to you months ago calling for this information to be released to the public. There is no danger to American interests from releasing it. And yet, you continue to resist calls to inform the public of this critical information.\" \r\nIt\u2019s so \u201cexplosive\u201d that it exploded into utter nothingness, according to the New York Times this [Tuesday] morning: \r\n\u201cFor much of the summer, the F.B.I. pursued a widening investigation into a Russian role in the American presidential campaign. Agents scrutinized advisers close to Donald J. Trump, looked for financial connections with Russian financial figures, searched for those involved in hacking the computers of Democrats, and even chased a lead \u2013 which they ultimately came to doubt \u2013 about a possible secret channel of email communication from the Trump Organization to a Russian bank. \r\n\u201cLaw enforcement officials say that none of the investigations so far have found any conclusive or direct link between Mr. Trump and the Russian government. And even the hacking into Democratic emails, FBI and intelligence officials now believe, was aimed at disrupting the presidential election rather than electing Mr. Trump.\u201d \r\nAs Gertrude Stein once put it, \u201cThere\u2019s no there there.\u201d She was talking about Oakland, California, but might just as well have been describing the inside of Harry\u2019s brain. \r\nAnd, yes, you read the above cited Times story right: instead of going after terrorists, or ordinary criminals, for months the FBI has been chasing down rabbit holes looking for Trump\u2019s alleged links to the nonexistent International Kremlin/Alt-Right/Putinist Conspiracy. We have returned to the halcyon days of J. Edgar Hoover, when people were investigated and harassed for their political views at the instigation of their ideological opponents. \r\nOh, but the FBI was too \u201c overburdened and undermanned \u201d to keep Omar Mateen on their radar. \r\nIn this election, the tragic and the comic mix and merge, but surely the former is dominant in the latest of Franklin Foer\u2019s Russophobic effusions. Formerly the editor of The New Republic , who was unceremoniously dumped by its new owner, Foer has teamed up with the Clinton campaign as its unofficial conspiracy theorist, spinning tales of Trump\u2019s \u201clinks\u201d to the Russians. He\u2019s the Alex Jones of the Clinton crowd, except that not even Jones would be caught dead promoting the kind of incoherent nonsense in Foer\u2019s latest screed . \r\nAccording to Foer, Trump has a \u201csecret server\u201d set up specifically to communicate with his Kremlin Masters. We know this because a \u201ccomputer scientist\u201d who wants to be known only as \u201cTea Leaves,\u201d and other \u201cexperts\u201d \u2013 who also don\u2019t want to tell us their names \u2013 have supposedly \u201cdiscovered\u201d this Secret Link. The server connects to the Alfa Bank, which is located in \u2013 cue in scary music \u2013 Russia! And guess what!? This closed communication link was especially active during politically sensitive times! This, according to Foer and his anonymous band of \u201cexperts,\u201d is conclusive proof that The Donald is a secret agent of the KGB, intent on polluting our precious bodily fluids with icky Russian cooties. \r\nThe only problem with this wacky conspiracy theory is that there\u2019s a prosaic explanation for the existence of this \u201csuspicious\u201d online traffic: the Trump Organization had hired a company to send out ads for their hotels. The online traffic to Alfa Bank meant only that several employees of that bank had stayed in Trump\u2019s hotels and were being solicited to do so again. And in spite of the \u201cscientific\u201d-looking chart displayed in the Foer piece, in fact the online traffic to and from Alfa didn\u2019t \u201cpeak\u201d when the US political scene got hot: \u201cThat\u2019s wrong,\u201d writes Timothy B. Lee in the anti-Trump pro-Hillary Vox.com. \u201cIf anything, the chart shows the opposite of that.\u201d \r\nAs Lee puts it: \r\n\u201c Foer claims that the pattern of traffic between the Trump Organization and Alfa Bank servers is highly unusual \u2013 so unusual that it can best be explained as a secretive communication link between Donald Trump and the Kremlin. \r\n\u201cBut in this case, there seems to be a plausible and perfectly innocent explanation for the traffic pattern suggested by an IT consultant named Naadir Jeewa and endorsed by security expert Robert Graham : The Trump organization is sending out promotional emails about Trump hotels, and one or more Alfa Bank employees is on the recipient list. \r\n\u201cThis is actually the explanation that\u2019s suggested by Occam\u2019s razor because \u2013 as Foer himself acknowledges in his story \u2013 the server was originally registered by an email marketing firm called Cendyn. The Trump organization seems to have hired Cendyn to send out emails promoting Trump\u2019s hotels, a service Cendyn has been providing since the Trump server was registered in 2009. So the most obvious explanation for the traffic is that Cendyn is using its server for its intended purpose.\u201d \r\nWhen Hillary Clinton\u2019s Twitter account tweeted Foer\u2019s farrago and declared \u201cIt\u2019s time for Trump to answer serious questions about his ties to Russia,\u201d cyber-security expert Robert Graham replied on his blog : \r\n\u201cThis is nonsense. The evidence available on the Internet is that Trump neither (directly) controls the domain \"trump-email.com,\" nor has access to the server. Instead, the domain was setup and controlled by Cendyn, a company that does marketing/promotions for hotels, including many of Trump\u2019s hotels. Cendyn outsources the email portions of its campaigns to a company called Listrak, which actually owns/operates the physical server in a data center in Philadelphia.\u201d \r\nSo the server wasn\u2019t even owned by the Trump Organization . And yet it took the FBI months, and \u201cjournalists,\u201d including even The Intercept , \u201cweeks\u201d to conclude that this story is completely bogus. The US taxpayers should demand their money back \u2013 not to mention Pierre Omidyar . \r\nEven after this sloppy McCarthyite smear was debunked, the Clinton campaign breathlessly repeated the charges: \u201cThis secret hotline may be the key to unlocking the mystery of Trump\u2019s ties to Russia\u201d! What this perfervid fantasy is the actually key to is the hysterical desperation of the Clinton campaign as it is engulfed in daily scandals that threaten to sink it beneath the electoral waves. \r\nAre you laughing \u2013 or crying \u2013 yet? Oh, but I\u2019m not done! If you think this grade-B conspiracy theory is the lowest form of electoral entertainment, then you obviously haven\u2019t read David Corn\u2019s latest entry into the Smear Trump Sweepstakes. Glenn Greenwald \u2013 no friend of Trump\u2019s \u2013 describes it as \u201can unnamed person, from an unknown country, who used to work in an unnamed agency, claims Trump is a Russian agent.\u201d How did the real estate mogul become a tool of the Kremlin? Well, you see, Trump once traveled to Russia, where he was suborned by one of those slinky-looking Russian ladies and \u201cRussian intelligence had \u2018compromised\u2019 Trump during his visits to Moscow and could \u2018blackmail him.\u2019\u201d \r\nYes, they\u2019re blackmailing Trump over a sexual indiscretion \u2013 because that would destroy him for sure ! And it\u2019s all in a \u201csecret memo\u201d that only Corn, the editors of Mother Jones , and their Mysterious Veteran Spook have seen. \r\nOn one level, this is hysterically funny; it\u2019s grade-C thriller material that is likely to be found at the bottom of some publisher\u2019s slush pile. On another level \u2013 the political level \u2013 it is immensely depressingly significant \u2013 because these people are \u201cliberals,\u201d even \u201cleftists.\u201d They aren\u2019t stupid: they know the ignominious history of witch-hunting in this country. I\u2019d call this McCarthyism \u2013 but even Joe McCarthy had some actual evidence to back up his claims of \u201cforeign agents\u201d lurking in the corridors of power. Corn, Foer, and the Clinton campaign are simply retailing lies. \r\nWhat\u2019s depressing about this is the fact that, if Hillary wins, it isn\u2019t going to stop. Far from it: the new \u201cred scare\u201d will accelerate, as her political enemies are tarred with the \u201cKGB agent\u201d brush. And when the notoriously vindictive Democratic candidate takes revenge not only on her domestic political enemies, but on the Russians, an ugly \u2013 and dangerous \u2013 confrontation is in the cards. She\u2019ll sic the FBI on Trump\u2019s supporters, and Trump himself, and she\u2019ll unleash the US military and our allies on Putin \u2013 and then, watch out. \r\nThat American liberalism has degenerated into a Russophobic, warmongering, witch-hunting ideology so quickly is one of the most astonishing ideological transformations in our political history. And all in the name of garnering partisan political advantage. As Donald Trump would put it: Sad! \r\nNOTES IN THE MARGIN \r\nYou can check out my Twitter feed by going here .

            "BREAKING: Racketeering indictment of Hillary Clinton now \u2018likely\u2019 as FOIA for Datto backup device reveals FBI possesses ALL the incriminating emails \r\n\r\nMike Adams The Health Ranger \r\n\r\nNaturalNews) Natural News can now reveal that dozens of democrat operatives will be facing criminal indictment from damning email evidence that has been in the possession of the FBI for more than a year. The bad news is that such indictments may take months to formally announce, with criminal proceedings requiring years to reach a conclusion. The good news is that Hillary Clinton isn\u2019t going to get away with her criminal racketeering for much longer, as the U.S. intelligence community is now determined to make sure she faces justice regardless of the outcome of next Tuesday\u2019s election. \r\nHere\u2019s the evidence that supports these assertions: \r\nFirst, FBI sources have told Fox News\u2019 Bret Baier that an indictment is \u201clikely.\u201d From Real Clear Politics : \r\nSources within the FBI have told him that an indictment is \u201clikely\u201d in the case of pay-for-play at the Clinton Foundation, \u201cbarring some obstruction in some way\u201d from the Justice Department. No doubt Loretta Lynch is determined to engage in that obstruction in one form or another, which is probably why Lynch herself may be among those who are eventually indicted for criminal conspiracy . \r\nSecond, this Oct. 28 announcement from Dr. Larry Kawa, working in partnership with Judicial Watch , reveals an astonishing discovery: That all of Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails were backed up to a \u201cDatto device\u201d long before she started deleting emails (i.e. destroying evidence). \r\nFrom the announcement: \r\nCitizen Activist Dr. Larry Kawa of Boca Raton, Florida today announced that he has expanded the scope of his efforts to bring former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u2019s hidden electronic communications to light. He is now calling for full disclosure of a hard drive that was turned over by Datto Inc. to the FBI as of 2015. According to CNN, the contents of the Datto hard drive are believed to contain all of Hillary Clinton\u2019s backed up electronic communications from her time as Secretary of State. The \u201cDatto device\u201d backups are now in the hands of the FBI \r\nIt turns out that Datto, Inc. is a data backup company which had real-time access to Hillary Clinton\u2019s private email server for the purpose of backing up her emails. That backup data set was turned over to the FBI in 2015, but the FBI likely did not realize what they were holding at the time. \r\nIt wasn\u2019t until the Clinton Foundation email scandal began to unfold that FBI agents realized what they possessed. Now, it turns out the FBI has been sorting through those emails (and other evidence) for more than a year. \r\nIn addition \u2014 and this is a real shocker for those who have been following this \u2014 the FBI did not destroy the laptops from Clinton\u2019s co-conspirators. \r\nVia Real Clear Politics: \r\nThe Clinton Foundation investigation is far more expansive than anybody has reported so far and has been going on for more than a year. The laptops of Clinton aides Cherryl Mills and Heather Samuelson have not been destroyed, and agents are currently combing through them. Now the FBI has at least FOUR sources of damning emails with overwhelming criminal evidence of Hillary Clinton\u2019s racketeering enterprise \r\nWhat all this means now is that the FBI has four sources of emails that Hillary Clinton and her close associates attempted to destroy: \r\nSource #1) Anthony Weiner\u2019s laptop , which somehow seems to have held 650,000 of Huma Abedin\u2019s emails, if reports are true, in addition to whatever child sexting pervert pics Weiner himself had collected (yeah, he\u2019s a democrat). \r\nSource #2) The non-destroyed laptops of Cherryl Mills and Heather Samuelson , which the media incorrectly reported had been destroyed as part of the FBI\u2019s investigation \u201cconclusion\u201d earlier this year. \r\nSource #3) The Datto, Inc. backup device which has already been turned over the FBI and likely contains all of Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails that she attempted to destroy (via Bleach Bit). \r\nSource #4) Wikileaks dumps of John Podesta emails which keep getting posted in large batches like clockwork, day after day, revealing astonishing layers of corruption and collusion among dozens of key players conspiring with the Clintons. From these four sources of emails, an undeniable pattern of criminal racketeering emerges \r\nAll this evidence isn\u2019t just going to incriminate Hillary Clinton, by the way: This vast conspiracy of criminal collusion, corruption, pay-to-pay bribery and racketeering will ensnare dozens \u2014 if not hundreds \u2014 of DNC operatives and Clinton Foundation cohorts. (Can we please release some non-violent drug offenders from the prisons to make room for the Clinton brigade?) \r\nIn case you didn\u2019t already realize this, we\u2019re now watching the uncovering of a massive criminal conspiracy involving hundreds of willing participants, spanning the DNC, the Dept. of Justice, the White House, the Clinton Foundation and of course the State Department. When it\u2019s all said and done, this will be the largest criminal conspiracy ever uncovered in the history of the United States of America . And it was all masterminded by a woman who claims that her vagina gives her some sort of special privilege to ascend to power in America. \r\nThe only downside to all this is that it might take years to fully prosecute the criminal cases against these Clinton criminals, and no doubt many of those who are guilty of committing these crimes will go free in exchange for testifying against their racketeering bosses. But the Clinton house of cards is now destined to fall, eventually ending one of the most shocking and dark chapters of American history and government corruption. Hillary Clinton\u2019s private email server was hacked by FIVE foreign intelligence agencies, says FBI source \r\nBeyond everything mentioned above, Hillary Clinton\u2019s illegal private email server has long since been compromised by multiple foreign intelligence agencies, allowing any of them to easily BLACKMAIL Clinton if she were to become President . \r\nVia Real Clear Politics : \r\nFBI sources say with 99% accuracy that Hillary Clinton\u2019s server has been hacked by at least five foreign intelligence agencies, and that information had been taken from it. \r\nThis means that from the very first moment Hillary Clinton might seize power in Washington D.C., she would be at the mercy of Chinese, Russian, North Korean or possibly even Iranian political leaders who would issue blackmail threats against her unless she granted them requested political favors. \r\nNotably, the entire leftist media is communicating absolutely none of this to its readers and viewers, counting on the true fact that most Clinton supporters are too stupid or too self-deluded to understand the high stakes game of international geopolitics. As a result, people who continue to say they support Hillary Clinton are, astonishingly, helping elect a criminal kingpin into the highest office the land\u2026 even as she has already been deeply compromised by foreign enemies that seek the outright destruction of the United States. \r\nThis is likely why the U.S. intelligence services \u2014 part of the \u201cdeep state\u201d apparatus \u2014 has now turned against Hillary Clinton and has made a decision to take her down . What every informed person now realizes \u2014 both in government and outside it \u2014 is that Hillary Clinton poses a clear and present danger to the national security of the United States of America , and that allowing her to seize power in Washington would spell outright doom for the nation and its people. Why the Huffington Post is also a danger to America \r\nRemember this as you browse the internet: Every website that\u2019s trying to get Clinton elected, including the Huffington Post, is working to place a seditious racketeering criminal into the highest office of the land. Such malicious acts are, in their own right, serious crimes against America, yet they characterize the entire delusional left-wing media and blogosphere, widely populated by academics who are so ignorant about the real world that they are incapable of recognizing the rise of a fascist, totalitarian regime even as it emerges in front of their very eyes. \r\nUniversities no longer teach students anything about the real world, you see, so a person can emerge from a top-tier university with a PhD while being so ignorant and deluded about reality that they would gladly vote for another Adolf Hitler if he dressed up in rainbow colors, chanted \u201clove wins\u201d and claimed to be transgender. (Bonus question: Could a biological man with a penis claim to self-identify as a woman and run for office under the premise of being the first \u201cwoman\u201d president? Cognitively obedient liberals \u2014 who are all completely insane morons \u2014 would no doubt vote for the \u201cwoman,\u201d achieving the incredible distinction of placing the first female into the White House who also had a scrotum and could pee standing up. Liberal historians take note\u2026 this is somehow called \u201cequality\u2026\u201d) \r\nEvery website rooting for Hillary Clinton is blindly pursuing the total damnation of America , all under the guise of \u201csocial justice\u201d or the silly pursuit of the \u201cfirst female President\u201d as if possessing a vagina is some sort of magical qualification for political superiority. \r\nImagine their mutual surprise when they soon discover that a vagina-possessing liberal politician turned out to be the most corrupt, dishonest and dangerous presidential candidate in history\u2026 a woman who created a massive criminal cartel and collected hundreds of millions of dollars in illegal profits while selling government influence to the highest international bidders. No penis required. So much for the glass ceiling theory, eh? \r\nIn summary, Hillary Clinton is a woman who once held the world by the balls\u2026 but then had to let go when the stank of her own putrid crimes was too much to stomach any longer. In the end, she will be remembered as nothing more than a crotchety old hag with a reptilian appetite for power and a sickening disregard for humankind. Prepare your in-flight vomit bags, folks, because this final approach to election day is going to involve nauseating turbulence and more than a few stomach-churning freefalls."

            "Dr. Eowyn | 2 Comments \r\nI\u2019ve been blogging every day, every week, every month for more than 7 years now. \r\nBlogging for FOTM requires that I\u2019m really \u201cplugged in,\u201d ear-to-the-ground on news and goings on, including conspiracy theories. \r\nAfter more than 7 years of being \u201cplugged in,\u201d I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that the conspiracy theories that I, who began as an innocent, had initially thought to be outlandish turn out to be credible. That\u2019s my honest, sober observation \u2014 from a person who is a full professor, has a Ph.D., was well-trained in and had taught epistemology and the scientific method to undergraduate and graduate students. I go to where the empirical evidence leads me. \r\nOne of the most far-out conspiracy theories is that a shadowy group of \u00e9lites controls governments. In the United States, those \u00e9lites variously are called shadow government, secret government or deep state. (See \u201c Deep State: Who really rules America \u201d) \r\nAn even more far-out version of that conspiracy theory is that the shadowy \u00e9lites are satanists. \r\nThis post is about Hillary Clinton and her close associates being satanists. Really. Exhibit A Larry Nichols in 2009 \r\nI originally reported the following more than a year ago in \u201c Clinton friend and assassin Larry Nichols says Hillary Clinton is a satanist \u201c. \r\nLarry Nichols is a former Green Beret and a longtime associate of Bill Clinton. The two men first met in Arkansas in the late 1970s when Bill was an up-and-coming politician. When Bill was elected governor of Arkansas, he inserted Nichols as the marketing director of the Arkansas Development Finance Authority , an Arkansas state agency that was one of the entities investigated by the Senate Whitewater Committee . \r\nOn the Pete Santilli radio show on September 24, 2013, Nichols admitted that he had killed people as the Clintons\u2019 hit man or assassin-for-hire. (See \u201c Bombshell: Long-time Clinton associate says he killed people for Bill & Hillary \u201c) \r\nOn June 24, 2015, interviewed by Alex Jones for InfoWars , Nichols dropped another bombshell. He said, beginning at the 28:44 mark in the audio above: \r\n\u201cBack when Hillary was first lady, she would go home on the weekends to California with Linda Bloodworth-Thomason * and some of the other ladies of \u2018Designing Women\u2019. And they went to a church for witches. Witches, witches, witches . . . . You know that lady that was tryin\u2019 to run for the Senate and sometimes she\u2019d gone to some place where they did witch stuff? Hillary went to a church and worshiped Satan . . . . What . . . I think is scaring the hell out of you: there are people that love them [Clintons], no matter what.\u201d \r\n* Note: Linda Bloodworth-Thomason, together with her husband Harry, was the producer of Designing Women , a popular TV sitcom (1986-1993). Exhibit B \r\nI first reported the following in a post about two months ago, \u201c Hillary aide talks about animal sacrifice to demon Moloch in WikiLeaks email \u201c. \r\nIn early August 2016, WikiLeaks released a (hacked) email from W. Lewis Amselem to Cheryl Mills, Hillary\u2019s chief of staff. At the time of the email, Amselem served in the State Department under then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton as head of the U.S. delegation to the Organization of American States (OAS). (He has since retired.) In the email, Amselem made mention of \u201csacrificing a chicken in the backyard to Moloch\u201d \u2014 an ancient demon. \r\nBelow is a screenshot I took of the WikiLeaks email (you can see the email for yourself here ). I painted a red bracket around the animal sacrifice phrase. \r\nIn the Old Testament , Gehenna was a valley by Jerusalem, where apostate Israelites and followers of various pagan gods sacrificed their children by fire (2 Chr. 28:3, 33:6; Jer. 7:31, 19:2\u20136). One of those gods was Moloch (aka Molech, Molekh, Molok, Molek, Molock, Moloc, Melech, Milcom or Molcom), an ancient Ammonite god who demanded a particular kind of propitiatory child sacrifice from parents. ( Amselem is a Sephardic Jewish surname.) Exhibit C \r\nThe latest evidence of satanism on the part of a Hillary Clinton associate is an email recently released by WikiLeaks . \r\nThe email was sent from Tony Podesta, a powerful Democrat lobbyist, to his brother John Podesta , a longtime Clinton associate who is the chairman of the 2016 Hillary Clinton presidential campaign. Tony had forwarded an invitation to attend a satanic ritual called \u201cspirit cooking dinner\u201d from Marina Abramovic, 69, a Serbian \u201cperformance artist\u201d who now lives in New York. Abramovic\u2019s email says: \r\n\u201cDear Tony, \r\nI am so looking forward to the Spirit Cooking dinner at my place. Do you think you will be able to let me know if your brother is joining? \u201c \r\nTony appended to Abramovic\u2019s invitation this message to John Podesta: \r\n\u201cAre you in NYC Thursday July 9 Marina wants you to come to dinner. \u201d Here\u2019s a screenshot of the email (you can view it on WikiLeaks here ): Paul Joseph Watson of InfoWars explains that \u201cspirit cooking\u201d is a \u201csacrament\u201d in Thelema \u2014 a religion founded by British occultist-satanist Aleister Crowley, whose motto was \u201cDo As Thou Wilt\u201d\u2014 in which menstrual blood, breast milk, urine and sperm are mixed to create a \u201cpainting.\u201d According to Abramovic, if the ritual is performed in an art gallery, it is merely art, but if the ritual is performed privately, then \u201cspirit cooking\u201d is a \u201cspiritual ceremony\u201d\u2014\u201cto symbolize the union between the microcosm, Man, and the macrocosm, the Divine\u201d and \u201ca representation of one of the prime maxims in Hermeticism \u2018As Above, So Below\u2019.\u201d Mike Cernovich cuts (no pun intended) to the quick: Spirit cooking is an \u201coccult practice used during sex cult rituals , as explained in the book Spirit cooking with essential aphrodisiac recipes .\u201d So who is Marina Abramovic? Let\u2019s begin with this disturbing image of Abramovic posing with a bloody goat\u2019s head \u2014 a representation of Baphomet: Here\u2019s a video of Abramovic on \u201cspirit cooking painting\u201d: Cassandra Fairbanks of WeAreChange.org has more information on Marina Abramovic: She is known for gory \u201cperformance art\u201d in the name of \u201cconfronting pain and ritual.\u201d One of Abramovic\u2019s performances involved repeatedly stabbing herself in her hands. Another featured her throwing her nails, toenails, and hair into a flaming pentagram, then jumping inside the pentagram and fainting. Exhibit D \r\nMany FBI agents involved in the now re-opened criminal investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails, who we would expect to know more about her than we do, regard Hillary Clinton as the antiChrist. \r\nSpencer Ackerman reports for The Guardian , Nov. 4, 2016: \r\n\u201cDeep antipathy to Hillary Clinton exists within the FBI, multiple bureau sources have told the Guardian, spurring a rapid series of leaks damaging to her campaign just days before the election. \r\nCurrent and former FBI officials, none of whom were willing or cleared to speak on the record, have described a chaotic internal climate that resulted from outrage over director James Comey\u2019s July decision not to recommend an indictment over Clinton\u2019s maintenance of a private email server on which classified information transited. \r\n\u2018The FBI is Trumpland,\u2019 said one current agent. [\u2026] \r\nThe currently serving FBI agent said Clinton is \u2018the antichrist personified to a large swath of FBI personnel ,\u2019 and that \u2018the reason why they\u2019re leaking is they\u2019re pro-Trump.\u2019\u201d \r\nH/t FOTM \u2018s Anon and Will Shanley \r\nSee also:"

            "We Are Change \r\n\r\nBill and Hillary Clinton have a long history of losing documents during various investigations and scandals over the years going all the way back to their time in Arkansas.\r\nIt\u2019s not just the current investigation into deleted emails in which the State Department\u2019s own internal probe found former Secretary of StatW Hillary Clinton violated federal record keeping laws . It\u2019s not just whitewater, it\u2019s several investigations where documents have turned up missing, exonerating the Clintons and clearing them of guilt, despite huge violations of obstruction of justice.\r\nHISTORY OF LOSING DOCUMENTS DURING INVESTIGATIONS: \r\nIn 1999, investigators looked into then First Lady Hillary and President Bill Clinton\u2019s scandals, which included Whitewater, Travelgate, Filegate and other scandals. It was discovered that more than 1 million subpoenaed emails were mysteriously \u201clost\u201d due to a \u201cglitch\u201d in a West Wing computer server . \r\nDuring the Project X email scandal, career White House staffers and contractors found that someone close to the first lady had basically turned off the White House\u2019s automated email archiving system. \r\nWHITEWATER: \r\nThe first notable case is the whitewater land scandal fiasco, which started in Arkansas when Bill Clinton was governor. The allegation is that the Clintons used the Rose Law Firm and the Arkansas Financial Department Authority, as well as Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan owned by Susan and Jim McDougal , to scam Arkansas residents. An investigation was started when the Clintons invested and lost money in the Whitewater Development Corporation.\r\nAn entire article could be dedicated to the Whitewater scandal, but what is important here is that documents for the whitewater investigation turned up missing were later discovered at the Clintons\u2019 home .\r\nBen Shapiro of Breitbart noted in his own article on Hillary\u2019s long history of hiding documents :\r\nIn 1996, a special Senate Whitewater committee released a report from the FBI demonstrating that documents sought in the Whitewater investigation had been found in the personal Clinton quarters of the White House. The First Lady\u2019s fingerprints were on them. The documents had gone mysteriously missing for two years. \r\nMark Fabiani, special White House counsel, immediately stated that there was no problem, according to the Times: \u201cHe added that she had testified under oath that she had nothing to do with the documents during the two years they were missing and did not know how they ended up in the family quarters.\u201d Hillary remains the only First Lady in American history to be fingerprinted by the FBI. Those weren\u2019t the only missing Whitewater documents later found in the Clinton White House. \r\nVINCE FOSTER: \r\nThe next notable case, which is also connected to Whitewater is Vince Foster. Foster worked alongside the Clintons as a top Rose Law firm attorney who had worked intimately with then First Lady Hillary Clinton throughout their career together. After Foster\u2019s \u201csuicide,\u201d documents went missing from his office . Secret Service officer Henry O\u2019Neill testified that he witnessed aides removing documents.\r\nSeveral years later, more documents pertaining to Hillary Clinton and Vince Foster again vanished, this time from the National Library including a document from Ken Star\u2019s investigation that proves that the \u201csuicide\u201d of Vince Foster was actually a murder . In those documents is the smoking gun that shows that Vince Foster sustained not one but two bullet wounds. One to the neck and one to the head an impossible suicide scenario.\r\nIn addition to that, experts have called Foster\u2019s suicide note \u201ca forgery.\u201d One of my rules is once, twice, okay, but three times is not a coincidence\u2014it\u2019s a criminal conspiracy. Conspiracy, as in the legal definition not a theory none of this is a theory when it\u2019s well sourced.\r\nTRAVEL GATE: \r\nIn 1996, the day before the Whitewater documents were found at the White House, a two-year-old memo emerged written by a former Presidential aide. According to the New York Times it proved that Hillary Clinton \u201chad played a far greater role in the dismissal of employees of the White House travel office than the Administration has acknowledged.\u201d \r\nPROJECT X EMAIL GATE: \r\nAccording to Tom Fitton, President of Judicial Watch, Hillary\u2019s top lawyer and top aide, Cheryl Mills \u201chelped orchestrate the cover-up of another major scandal, often referred to as \u2018Project X Email-gate.\u2019\u201d Over the course of years, the Clinton Administration allegedly withheld 1.8 million email communications from Judicial Watch\u2019s attorneys, as well as federal investigators and Congress. In addition, Judicial Watch says that when a White House computer contractor attempted to reveal the emails, White House officials \u201cinstructed her to keep her mouth shut about the hidden e-mail or face dismissal and jail time.\u201d \r\n2015-2016 EMAIL GATE: \r\nWhere do I start about the botched investigation of Hillary\u2019s private email server? The obstruction of justice is so broad, it\u2019s insane. She used \u201cbleach bit\u201d software the day after being subpoenaed, smashed several BlackBerrys and iPads with hammers, was tipped off by the DoJ and DoS into the investigation, according to Wikileaks, etc.\r\nClinton\u2019s close ally Terry McAulife gave a donation to the wife of the Deputy Director Of The FBI. Bill Clinton met with Attorney General Loretta Lynch towards the end of the investigation. The list goes on\u2026\r\n2 TERABYTES OF DATA MISSING: \r\nTwo terrabyte drive with Clinton White House emails missing, presumed stolen from National Archives https://t.co/p3eZqxKxke pic.twitter.com/792rxje642 \r\n\u2014 WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) November 3, 2016 \r\n\r\nYet even with all of the evidence, the current FBI director\u2014who has been revealed to be connected to the Clintons\u2014has once again refused to acknowledge the corrupt career nature of the Clintons.\r\nDirector James Comey told Congress Sunday that the FBI does not recommend charges against Clinton, even after an additional 650,000 emails were discovered on the laptop of her aide\u2019s estranged husband, Anthony Weiner.\r\nWhether it\u2019s deleting emails or covering up documents to prevent prosecution, it has always been the Clinton way. Why is it that journalists can uncover this past historic information, but the FBI investigators can\u2019t? \r\nSomething isn\u2019t right. Drain the swamp and nominate AK for FBI Director 2017, and stay tuned to We Are Change. This case is closed. The Clintons are corrupt. That, or documents have somehow developed an artificial intelligence to stay away from the Clintons. It must be a right wing conspiracy. I would be willing to put my deplorable eggs into one basket and say it\u2019s the latter.\r\nThe post OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE: The Clintons\u2019 Long History Of Losing Documents appeared first on We Are Change ."

            "\u2018Conspiracy Vs. Government\u2019 Is Part of an Elite Wave of Propaganda Justifying Violent Repression By - October 31, 2016 \r\nThe rise of paranoid politics could make America ungovernable \u2013 and the FBI is fuelling the fire \u2026 Nothing can disprove the fears of a paranoiac. Indeed, everything confirms them \u2026 It takes away politicians\u2019 incentive to understand one another and get things done. It says that if you scream loud enough, established norms will buckle under the pressure. And while those norms might be annoying and flawed, we\u2019ll all miss them if they go. \u2013UK Telegraph \r\nWith US belief in \u201cconspiracy theory\u201d over 50 percent (see our previous article here ) elites are showing increasing concern that they have lost control of their narrative. \r\nThis article again illustrates elite push back. The article explains that if people grow paranoid about government, then the \u201cnorms\u201d of government will collapse. \r\nConspiracy theory is called \u201cparanoid politics\u201d in this article but it amounts to the same thing. \r\nThe article also has parallels to an article we analyzed recently here by Cass Sunstein. His Bloomberg editorial suggested that nothing was more important from a political standpoint than returning \u201ccivility\u201d to Congress and politics generally. \r\nThis article runs along the same lines: Negative perceptions of the US government can make the process of \u201cgoverning\u201d dysfunctional \r\nMore: \r\nTake the \u201cchemtrails\u201d conspiracy theory: the idea that the white trails left behind in the sky by aeroplanes are sinister chemicals dispersed to sterilise or control voters. \r\nIf a government declares there is \u201cno evidence\u201d of such chemicals, that itself must be clear evidence that there\u2019s something \u201cthey\u201d don\u2019t want us to know. But if that government were to open up an investigation, that too would be incontrovertible proof: \u201cthey\u201d must have found something. \r\nLet\u2019s reverse this reasoning. Apparently, one can\u2019t question much that government does because skepticism puts government in a no-win situation. \r\nBetter to accept official pronouncements, then. The only trouble is that almost anything modern Western governments say are lies. \r\nGovernments aren\u2019t even important these days. The world from what we can tell is run by a small banking elite that controls the awesome power of central banks and the money they print. \r\nThe trillions available to this small group has allowed it to change the nature of society around the world. \r\nThe goal is global government and every kind of violence and corruption is employed to achieve it. \r\nSecrecy is still employed by those creating \u201cone world.\u201d Thus the world is bent on the task of creating global governance while never admitting it. \r\nBut in the past several decades, the Internet has credibly exposed plans for world government. As a result, people have lost faith in mainstream media, politicians and capitalism itself. \r\nThis is the reason for the rise in \u201cconspiracy theory\u201d and \u201cparanoid politics.\u201d \r\nThis is also the reason elites would like to shut down the Internet, or at least control it more thoroughly. \r\nPart of the push for control involves making a case that the Internet needs to be better regulated and appropriately censored. \r\nTo this end, elite propaganda has been aimed at justifying various anti-\u2018Net actions. \r\nOne justification involves the \u201cpopulism versus globalism\u201d meme we\u2019ve covered extensively. (Just use a search engine for the phrase and \u201cDaily Bell.\u201d) \r\nAnother justification \u2013 another emergent meme \u2013 is that government itself is jeopardized by pervasive distrust. \r\nOne would think the answer would be to lie less, but this is not the conclusion we\u2019re being furnished. \r\nBoth Sunstein in his article, and now the argument in this article, show us clearly that the solution to pervasive electoral cyncism and worse is to better control one\u2019s attitude. \r\nIn other words, paranoia and conspiratorial cynicism need to be damped for government to survive and perform its proper function. \r\nHere: \r\nWhy, then, did a seasoned operator like Mr Comey, whose judiciousness was praised by the Clinton campaign through the summer, feel the need to divulge this half-baked and potentially insignificant development before assessing it? There is one answer: fear of the mob. \r\nThe director of the FBI \u2013 those tough guys who smash in doors and shoot people \u2013 was scared that if he didn\u2019t talk now and the news leaked out, it would confirm every conspiracy theory going about how the agency was in the Clintons\u2019 pocket. In other words, we\u2019ve reached a point in the politics of the world\u2019s most powerful democracy where the appearance of probity matters more than the reality. \r\nThis is a key point in the article. It is one that fully reveals the cognitive dissonance at the heart of this particular argument. The idea is that government is too delicate to sustain itself in the face of the \u201cmob.\u201d The mob must therefore be silenced or \u201cprobity will matter more than reality.\u201d \r\nBut who is to determine what constitutes a \u201cmob\u201d? And who is determine that the mob\u2019s \u201creality\u201d is false? \r\nBoth the Sunstein article and now this one are erecting very specific kinds of arguments. Government, we are told, is fragile and must be protected from forces that will undermine its credibility. \r\nBut this conclusion is merely assumed. It is never proven. \r\nThis argument begins and ends with government. Yet the Internet and its recovered history shows us clearly that Western governments mostly provide concealment for the world\u2019s real powers that prefer to operate behind the scenes. \r\nThis is the reason for so much cynicism. Many have realized that the society constructed around them is lie. They have reacted by distrusting almost anything associated with modern society. \r\nBut in these articles, we can see the forces being marshaled against this state of mind. The preferred antidote is simply to assert that people\u2019s distrust is corrosive to government authority and democracy generally. \r\nNo logic bolsters this argument. That\u2019s why it is an emergent elite meme. \r\nThe goal of an elite meme is to be convincing not truthful. \r\nAnd if it is not convincing \u2013 and increasingly elite memes are not \u2013 then its function is, anyway, to provide a justification for what we call directed history. These are the authoritarian strategies that elites wish to inflict on the rest of us. \r\nThis latter meme is an outgrowth of \u201cpopulism versus globalism.\u201d Populists, as we\u2019ve pointed out, are being cast as ignorant, violent and intolerant. The current meme \u2013 let\u2019s call it \u201cconspiracy versus government\u201d\u2013 lumps in conspiracy with populism. \r\nPopulists, we learn, are apt to adopt an irrational distrust of government. And what is government? It must comprise all that is good and virtuous in an uncivil world. \r\nBoth populists and conspiracy theory are to be vanquished, eventually, by wise globalists who understand that the absence of government will lead to violent \u201canarchy.\u201d \r\nWould that it were true. It is not. Government is merely in this day-and-age a curtain hiding the world\u2019s real controllers who use endless violence, monetary debasement and economic depression to get their way. \r\nConclusion: We are watching the emergence of a new, dangerous memes. Increasingly and forcefully, it is being argued that \u201cgovernment\u201d is good and that the truths people have discovered about their lives and society are destabilizing to government, and therefore \u201cbad.\u201d The idea will be to use these memes to make a case for increased censorship and even, eventually, violent repression \u2013 and worse."
