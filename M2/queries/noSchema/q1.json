            "Russia Unveils Update of Advanced Nuclear Weapon 10/26/2016 \r\nEPOCH TIMES \r\nRussia has unveiled a new nuclear missile that \u201cis capable of wiping out parts of the earth the size of Texas or France.\u201d \r\nReports say that the RS-28 missile, dubbed the \u201cSatan 2,\u201d was unveiled this week, with the first image of the weapon being released to the public by designers at the Makeyev Rocket Design Bureau . It\u2019s also known as \u201cSarmat\u201d in Russian. \r\nThe report comes as Moscow has been flexing its military muscle amid tensions with the United States over the war in Syria and lingering fallout from the invasion of Crimea in Ukraine. NATO, meanwhile, has been shoring up its defenses in countries near Russia\u2019s border amid concerns about its military direction. \r\n\u201cThe prospective strategic missile system is being developed in order to assuredly and effectively fulfill objectives of nuclear deterrent by Russia\u2019s strategic forces,\u201d according to a statement from V. Degtar and Y. Kaverin, listed as the bomb\u2019s chief designer and leading designer, respectively, reported RT , a Russian government-funded news site. \r\nEarlier this year, the Kremlin-aligned Sputnik News website said the missile could \u201cwipe out\u201d portions of the earth the \u201csize of Texas or France.\u201d \r\nThe RS-28 will replace the R-36, which was called the \u201cSS-18 Satan\u201d by NATO when it was introduced in the 1970s. \r\nRobert Kelley, a former nuclear weapons expert at the U.S. Department of Energy, told NBC News that the new missile most likely had an upgrade in the device\u2019s electronics, rather than an increase in its explosive payload or range. \r\n\u201cThe range of the missiles will be about the same, the explosive destructive power will be about the same [but] the reliability, flexibility and confidence [in the warheads\u2019 ability to hit their targets] will go way up,\u201d said Kelley. \r\nHe noted: \u201cYour iPhone can do thousands of more things today than in the 1970s when these systems were first deployed. Many of the clunky electronic circuits of that era no longer exist and no one knows how to make them anymore.\u201d \r\nThe RS-28 weighs about 100 tons, and it features a large, 10-ton nuclear payload capacity. The missile is expected to enter service in 2018."

            "US Military Hackers Claim Penetration of Russia 11/07/2016 \r\nSPUTNIK NEWS \r\nUS military hackers have penetrated Russia\u2019s electric grid, telecommunications networks and Kremlin\u2019s command systems, making them vulnerable to attack by secret American cyber weapons, according to a series of reports by a major US television network. \r\nNBC News disclosed the penetration in a series of reports, explaining that US efforts parallel claims, also by US officials, that Russia, China and other nations have placed hidden malware on parts of US critical infrastructure. \r\nThe penetration by all sides appears to be in preparation for an all-out war in cyberspace, according to NBC News, which said it was briefed by a US intelligence official and given an opportunity to review highly classified documents. \r\nAt the same time, the network downplayed the prospect of a cyber war, making it appear as if the leak was intended as a warning to US adversaries. \r\nNBC News then attempted to link its explosive report to Tuesday\u2019s US presidential election, citing concerns of mischief by Russian hackers that would fall far short of the Armageddon-like scenario that the report implied. \r\nInstead, the network explained US election-related concerns as \u201ccyber mischief,\u201d which could involve releasing fake documents or creating bogus social media accounts to spread misinformation. \r\nThe Obama administration has created a public, but unconfirmed narrative, that hackers controlled by the Russian government have stolen emails from the Democratic Party headquarters, a private computer used by presidential candidate Hillary Clinton while serving as secretary of State and computers used by Clinton campaign Chairman John Podesta. \r\nAccording to the narrative, Russia stole the emails and gave the messages to WikiLeaks, which has flooded the internet with the material on a daily basis leading up to Tuesday\u2019s election. \r\nRussia has denied any responsibility for the Clinton-related hacks and links between WikiLeaks and Russian intelligence have never been substantiated. \r\nMoreover, recent media reports in the United States indicate that Clinton\u2019s private server she used for official business during her tenure as secretary of state had been penetrated by at least five foreign intelligence services. \r\nThe emails have proved especially embarrassing for the Clinton campaign by disclosing decisions in the Clinton State Department that favored large donors to the Clinton Foundation in what appear to be \u201cpay-for-play\u201d schemes of selling access and influence. \r\nMoreover, the activity appears to coincide with lucrative speaking engagements for former President Bill Clinton."

            "Russia, China Look To Autonomous Financial System 11/07/2016 \r\nTASS.COM \r\nRussia and China need to create an autonomous financial system which would be minimally subject to political risks and external pressure, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said in an interview with the Chinese Central Television (CCTV). \r\n\u201cAs I see it, what should we be guided with in creating a modern financial system in the People\u2019s Republic of China and in the Russian Federation?\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to set up a modern, protected and simultaneously quite autonomous financial system, which would be subject to political risks to a lesser degree.\u201d Nowadays, Russia and China are considering integration of Russia\u2019s national payment system, the Mir bank cards, and China\u2019s UnionPay system, he said. \r\n\u201cIn our view, it would help to enhance the reliability of payments,\u201d Medvedev said, adding that sometimes some countries were trying to exert \u201call sorts of political pressure.\u201d European banks had been regularly fined by US financial authorities and financial companies, he added. \r\n\u201cThey say \u2018We will take ten billion euros from a French bank and seven billion euros from a German bank\u2019. Our European partners agree with this,\u201d Medvedev said. \r\n\u201cI am not speaking about the nature of these disputes but that we must protect our financial systems. China must protect its own system and Russia must protect its own system. Therefore, this cooperation is very useful as in this situation no-one will be capable of blocking the road of financial traffic,\u201d he emphasized. Russia looks to predictability of China\u2019s economic growth \r\nRussia expects that China\u2019s economic growth will be predictable and is set to cooperate with Chinese partners for the purpose, Russia\u2019s Prime Minister said in an interview. \r\n\u201cWe are interested in predictability of China\u2019s economy growth and so we are ready to work with our Chinese partners,\u201d Medvedev said, adding the Russian government was implementing a plan aimed to boost the economic growth. \r\n\u201cActually, everyone needs it. Our country needs it as recently we have been plunged in a phase of such decline. Both European and US economies need it since they have not been gaining fast growth, to say nothing about Japan. Also, the Chinese economy needs it since it had been gathering speed in the past years but has slowed down later,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is closely watched by everyone as China\u2019s economy is the most significant factor of the world economic growth.\u201d. Energy and high technology sectors \r\nRussia and China may reach the goal of $200bln trade by 2020 but energy and high technology sectors along with traditional trade should move up a gear, Russian Prime Minister said. \r\n\u201cIndicators have been improving this year as a result of joint work of the two states, including our countries\u2019 leaders, governments, ministries, agencies and businesses,\u201d Medvedev said. Russia, China intend to develop small satellite for Wi-Fi network \r\n\u201cI am convinced that if we move ahead like this, by 2020 we will be able to reach the trade of $200 billion worth. However, attention should be turned to key aspects of cooperation,\u201d he said explaining he implied the energy sector, with some projects like the Power of Siberia gas pipeline. \r\n\u201cIn 2015 construction of an eastern stretch of the gas pipeline was launched,\u201d he said. \u201cAlso, it includes oil supplies along the Skovorodino-Mohe (oil pipeline) extension and construction of large facilities, in particular the construction of Unit 3 at the Tianwan Nuclear Power Plant.\u201d \r\nBesides, high-tech projects should be enhanced, he said. \r\n\u201cI mean wide-body jets, heavy helicopters and other projects in the high-tech sector,\u201d Medvedev said. \u201cIt seems to me that if we diversify trade like this, our countries will be quite capable of reaching the level which we agreed on several years ago,\u201d he said in conclusion.

            "Nuclear tensions between US, Russia reach \u2018dangerous\u2019 point 10/31/2016 \r\nPRESS TV \r\nUS-Russian relations have slipped to their lowest point since the end of the Cold War, with tensions now spilling over to nuclear pacts and each side accusing the other of cheating, experts say. \r\n\u201cI would have to say that, without question, this is the low point in US-Russian relations since the end of the Cold War,\u201d Steven Pifer, an arms control expert at the Brookings Institution, told NPR. \r\nThe relationship took a turn for the worse two years ago with the conflict in Ukraine and slid lower last year with Russia\u2019s air campaign in Syria, noted Pifer, a former US ambassador to Ukraine. \r\nThis year, tensions have continued to mount with Russian and US aircraft buzzing each other over the Baltic and Washington accusing Moscow of trying to interfere in the US presidential elections, he added. \r\nBickering over nuclear issues has also increased markedly in recent months. \r\nEarly this month, Russia moved a battery of nuclear-capable missile launchers within range of three Baltic states, in what US officials said was a gesture to express displeasure with NATO.

(Photo by Reuters) \r\nIn late October, Russia unveiled images of a new intercontinental ballistic missile dubbed the Satan 2, which, it says, can carry up to 15 separate warheads powerful enough to destroy an area the size of Texas. \r\nThe US, in September, flew three long-range nuclear bombers over Eastern Europe to participate in NATO military exercises. \r\nThese developments have worried nuclear arms experts. \r\n\u201cWe are in a dangerous situation,\u201d Hans Kristensen, director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists, told NPR. \u201cCertainly a situation that is much more dire or tense than it was 10 years ago.\u201d \r\nIn 1987, four years before the Soviet Union collapsed, Washington and Moscow signed a long-negotiated treaty \u2013 known as the Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces Treaty \u2013 to eliminate their arsenals of nuclear and conventional ground-launched ballistic and cruise missiles with ranges of 500 to 5,500 kilometers. \r\n\u201cSince May 2013, the Obama administration has repeatedly raised concerns with Russia regarding its lack of compliance with the INF Treaty,\u201d a senior administration official told NPR on condition of anonymity. \r\nThe official said Washington has called for a rare meeting of the treaty\u2019s Special Verification Commission \u201cin the coming weeks\u201d to try to resolve the matter. \r\n\u201cI actually think this is a good step,\u201d Pifer said of the decision. \r\nThe US claims that an intermediate-range missile being developed by Russia is not in line with the INF Treaty and wants clarification from Moscow. \r\n\u201cWhat the administration has said is that they provided enough information to the Russians so that the Russians could identify the missile in question. The Russians thus far have said no, they haven\u2019t got enough information, so you\u2019re in that kind of war of words,\u201d Pifer added. President Putin speaks during a news conference. (File photo by AFP) \r\nThe war of words further escalated in early October when Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the suspension of a Cold War deal with the US to dispose of weapons-grade plutonium. \r\n\u201cThat, I believe, was a little bit of a poke at President Obama, who attaches a lot of importance to the nuclear nonproliferation agenda,\u201d Pifer said. \r\nTensions are bound to mount even further over the next few months as the US and its NATO allies prepare to move thousands of troops as well as heavy military equipment to countries along and near Russia\u2019s border, namely Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. A US Army convoy rolls through Liepupe, Latvia, on its way from Estonia to Germany. (Photo by European Pressphoto Agency) \r\n\u201cThis is a gradual sort of escalation of tensions between the two sides that goes beyond discourse and just disagreements over a treaty,\u201d Kristensen said. \u201cIt\u2019s getting pretty deep now.\u201d \r\nThe rising tensions between the two nuclear powers have other experts worried. \r\n\u201cWe could head into a nuclear conflict which would devastate humanity,\u201d American writer and retired professor James Petras told Press TV earlier this month. \r\n\u201cWe need to move away from this saber-rattling from Washington into a position that could come to terms with peaceful co-existence, but I don\u2019t see that on the horizon in present or the near future with either Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump as presidential candidates,\u201d he said."

            "NATO, Russia To Hold Parallel Exercises In Balkans 11/02/2016 \r\nPRESS TV \r\nRussia\u2019s military and NATO forces are holding parallel military exercises in two neighboring Balkan countries. \r\nRussian troops will participate in war games in Serbia while NATO is conducting military drills in Montenegro, media reported on Monday. \r\nRussian forces\u2019 13-day military exercise in Serbia is named \u201cThe Slavic Brotherhood 2016\u201d and begins on Wednesday. \r\nIt will include 150 Russian paratroopers, 50 air force staffers, three transport planes and an unspecified number of troops from Serbia and Belarus, Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry said. \r\nThe five-day NATO drill in Montenegro started on Monday and involves responding to floods and chemical attacks. It will involve 680 unarmed personnel from seven NATO countries and 10 partner states. \r\nIn the past both Serbia and Montenegro were constitutional republics of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. \r\nBoth countries are socialist republics and traditional Russian Christian Orthodox allies. In 2003 this state union was re-formed into Serbia and Montenegro, and in 2006 the two became independent states. \r\nSince their split, the two Balkan neighbors seem to have headed in different directions strategically. \r\nMontenegro has taken a pro-Western stance which has been awarded by NATO with an offer to join the Northern Atlantic Alliance. \r\nThe NATO invitation to Montenegro has met strong opposition from Russia. \r\nMeanwhile, Montenegrin officials have accused Russia of staging an alleged coup in October to topple its pro-Western government because of the NATO accession bid. \r\nSerbia, a NATO partner, has held exercises with the Western alliance, but not such a large one or with foreign troops and equipment participating on its soil."

            "Russia-US Plutonium Deal No Longer In Effect 11/02/2016 \r\nRUSSIA TODAY President Vladimir Putin has signed an act suspending a 2000 agreement between the US and Russia on reprocessing weapons-grade plutonium extracted from decommissioned warheads. \r\nThe bill has already been published on Russia\u2019s official legal information website, meaning it\u2019s now in force. \r\nIt mentions that a decision to restore the agreement can only be made by Russia\u2019s president. \r\nThe deal between Moscow and Washington was ratified in 2000. As a means to safely utilize weapons-grade plutonium, it suggested a specific procedure to turn it into nuclear plant fuel. Starting from 2018, it was planned to reprocess 34 tons (68,000 pounds) of plutonium, which would have been enough to produce thousands of nuclear weapons, RIA Novosti reported. \r\nYet, while Russia has prepared the infrastructure necessary for the process, the US said it found the procedure too costly and instead opted for mixing plutonium with special dilutants to store it indefinitely. \r\nRussia suspended the deal \u201c due to drastic changes of circumstances, the rise of threat to strategic stability as a result of hostile actions of the US towards the Russian Federation and the inability of the US to provide for the accepted obligations to utilize the excess weapons-grade plutonium in accordance with the agreement ,\u201d the new bill read. \r\nFor the agreement to be resumed, Washington should reduce the US military presence on the territory of NATO members that joined the bloc after 2000, cancel its Magnitsky Act which bans entry to the US to a list of Russian citizens, as well as lift other anti-Russian sanctions and compensate the loss Moscow suffered as a result of such policy. \r\nThe bill on suspension \u2013 which is a \u201c forced measure ,\u201d according to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov \u2013 was first submitted by the president\u2019s office earlier this month and then approved by parliament. \r\nCommenting on the suspension of the deal, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov has said that it would not affect any of Moscow\u2019s other commitments related to international nuclear security and does not interfere with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty."

Fresh attempts at containing Russia and continuing the empire have been met with countermoves. Russia appears to be building strength in every way. Putin and his country have no intention of being under the American thumb, and are developing rapid resistance as the U.S. petrodollar loses its grip and China, Russia and the East shift into new currencies and shifting world order. \r\nWhat lies ahead? It will be a strong hand for the countries that have the most significant backing in gold and hard assets; and China and Russia have positioned themselves very well. Prepare for a changing economic landscape, and one in which self-reliance might be all we have. \r\nRussia is Hoarding Gold at an Alarming Rate \u2014 The Next World War Will Be Fought with Currencies \r\nby Jay Syrmopoulos \r\nWith all eyes on Russia\u2019s unveiling their latest nuclear intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), which NATO has dubbed the \u201cSATAN\u201d missile , as tensions with the U.S. increase, Moscow\u2019s most potent \u201cweapon\u201d may be something drastically different. \r\nThe rapidly evolving geopolitical \u201cweapon\u201d brandished by Russia is an ever increasing stockpile of gold, as well as Russia\u2019s native currency, the ruble. \r\nTake a look at the symbol below, as it could soon come to change the entire hierarchy of the international order \u2013 potentially ushering in a complete international paradigm shift \u2013 and much sooner than you might think. \r\nimage: http://thefreethoughtproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/bankofrussia-e1475520013798.png \r\nThe symbol is the new designation of the Russian ruble, Russia\u2019s national currency. \r\nSimilar to how the U.S. uses the dollar sign ($), the U.K. uses the pound sign (\u00a3), and the European Union uses the euro symbol (\u20ac), Russia is about to begin exporting its symbol internationally. \r\nAfter the failed \u201creset\u201d in U.S./Russian relations by the Obama administration, and the continued deterioration of the countries relationship, Washington began targeting entire sectors of the Russian economy, as well as specific individuals, meant to impose an economic burden so severe that it would force Moscow into compliance. \r\nInstead of decimating Russia, what it precipitated was a Russian response of gradually weaning themselves off of the hegemony of the U.S. petrodollar, and working with China to create an alternative to the SWIFT payment system that isn\u2019t solely controlled by Western interests (see Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank , New Development Bank). \r\nAccording to the Corbett Report : \r\nNew reports indicate that China is ready to launch its SWIFT alternative, and for those who have their ear to the ground this is the most significant move yet in the unfolding process of de-dollarization that is seeing the BRICS-led \u201cresistance bloc\u201d breaking away from the financial stranglehold of the US-led \u201cWashington Consensus.\u201d \r\nFor those who don\u2019t know, SWIFT stands for the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication and is shorthand for the SWIFTNet Network that is used by over 10,500 financial institutions in 215 countries and territories to transmit financial transaction data around the world. SWIFT does not do any of the clearing or processing for these transactions itself, but instead sends the payment orders that are then settled by correspondent banks of the member institutions. Still, given the system\u2019s near universality in the financial system, it means that virtually every international transaction between banking institutions goes through the SWIFT network. \r\nThis is why de-listing from the SWIFT network remains one of the primary financial weapons wielded by the US and its allies in their increasingly important financial warfare campaigns. \r\nRecently, financial guru Jim Rickards, author of the book \u201cCurrency Wars,\u201d wrote that \u201cRussia is poised for a major comeback in its economy. Russian bonds and stocks and the Russian currency, the ruble, will all benefit.\u201d Rickards believes a \u201cstrong turnaround\u201d is coming within Russia, and that this comeback will benefit the ruble. \r\nWhile still suffering from the economic warfare being waged by the U.S., Russia has realized that as long they are subservient to the petrodollar, there remains a clear and present danger of the Russian economy being devastated by the whims of Washington. \r\nThe Bank of Russia, that nation\u2019s central bank, is extremely clear about its mission, and monetary policy declaring on its website: \r\nMonetary policy constitutes an integral part of the state policy and is aimed at enhancing well-being of Russian citizens. The Bank of Russia implements monetary policy in the framework of inflation-targeting regime, and sees price stability, albeit sustainably low inflation, as its priority. Given structural peculiarities of the Russian economy, the target is to reduce inflation to 4% by 2017 and maintain it within that range in the medium run. \r\nIn layman\u2019s terms, that means that monetary policy, similar to nuclear weapons and the military, are \u201can integral part of the state policy\u201d in Russia. While many analysts have noted the increased build-up in Russia\u2019s military arsenal, seemingly few have highlighted the massive build-up of Russian gold reserves over the past decade. \r\nBelow is a chart showing Russian gold reserves between 1994 and last year, 2015: \r\nSince 2006, there has been a year-on-year increase that reveals a significant upward trend. The chart clearly reveals that Russia\u2019s state policy of increasing state monetary assets, in the form of gold. Additionally, the Russian government has been converting state rubles into gold assets. From 2006 to 2015, Russia\u2019s state holdings of gold tripled. \r\nWithin just the past year Russia has substantially increased its gold holdings \r\nAccording to the Business Insider : \r\nIn July of this year, the central bank of Russia added 200,000 ounces of gold to its reserves. The one-month uptick in Russian gold reserves \u2014 200,000 ounces \u2014 is approximately equal to the entire annual output of Barrick Gold\u2019s Turquoise Ridge gold mine in Nevada. \r\nAt that same rate \u2014 200,000 ounces per month \u2014 in a mere five months, Russia would add to state gold reserves the equivalent of the entire annual output of Barrick\u2019s massive Goldstrike mine in Nevada. \r\nCurrently, Russian gold reserves rank seventh in the world. It\u2019s clear that there is a concerted effort by Russian authorities to build up the country\u2019s gold reserves as part of a national strategy to negate the effects of economic warfare waged by the United States. \r\nRickards, in his 2011 book \u201cCurrency Wars,\u201d theorized that Russia and China could combine their gold reserves to form a global gold-backed currency to compete against the U.S. dollar. Currently, Russian reserves stand at roughly 1,500 tonnes, with Chinese reserves totaling over 1,800 tonnes (according to China \u2014 it\u2019s likely more), which would amount to a combined total of roughly 3,300 tonnes of gold. \r\nThe U.S. is about to lose overarching control of policymaking within the International Monetary Fund (IMF), thus the U.S. lockup on global gold is about to vanish, according to Business Insider. \r\nImagine for a moment the distinctly real possibility that Russian-Chinese alliance could exercise indirect (or even direct) control over the IMF\u2019s gold reserve of over 2,800 tonnes. Russian, Chinese and IMF gold combined would equal roughly 6,100 tonnes, and would allow for direct competition with the U.S. gold reserves, estimated at 8,100 tonnes. \r\nRussia and China have realized that the petrodollar is wielded by Washington as it\u2019s weapon of choice when opposing a well-armed state, and clearly see the writing on the wall \u2013 thus working together to create a new global financial paradigm. \r\nThe reality is that the United States is $20 trillion dollars in debt, and eventually the time will come when the U.S. economy begins to implode \u2014 and all the fiat currency people are stuck holding will essentially be worth nothing more than the paper it\u2019s printed on. Hard assets, such as gold and silver, should be bought and taken custody of while there is still an opportunity to do so, as a means of hedging against the potentially disastrous results of the U.S. using the petrodollar as a \u201cweapon.\u201d \r\nUltimately, the United States, Russia and China are all controlled by centralized power-hungry tyrants attempting to command powerful global bureaucracies like the IMF, the World Bank, SWIFT, New Development Bank and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. \r\nIt\u2019s not Russian nuclear weapons that people should fear, as the policy of mutually assured destruction essentially voids any benefit of a state launching a first-strike nuclear attack. The true threat to America is our economic house of cards, built upon the back of a neoliberal trade policy that puts the \u201crights\u201d of corporations over that of people . \r\nThis article was written by Jay Syrmopoulos and originally published at The Free Thought Project ."

            "block the US from being stationed on the islands off Hokkaido in the strategic Sea of Okhotsk, if this helps persuade Russia to give them back. \r\nThe islands are inhabited, and in Russia are called the Southern Kurils \u2013 but for Japan they are Etorofu, Kunashiri, Shikotan, and the Habomai islet group. These territories, which became Russian after Japan\u2019s defeat in World War II under the San Francisco Peace Treaty of 1951, saw a rift between the two countries preventing them from signing the peace treaty to formally end the war. Tokyo insists the four islets are not part of the Kuril chain and should be returned under its control. \r\nIn September, Russian President Vladimir Putin told Bloomberg that Russia does not \u201ctrade territories.\u201d But ahead of his visit to Tokyo in mid-December, Japan\u2019s diplomatic sources told Kyodo News that Moscow would hand over Shikotan and Habomai islet group following the peace deal, as stated by the 1956 Japan-Soviet Joint Declaration. \r\nThe sources, however, said Russia may be concerned that the US military could be stationed on the territories after Japan gets them back. According to Article 5 of the Japan-US security treaty, Washington is allowed to station its troops in areas administered by Japan. \r\nThe Japanese government is now looking into the potential consequences, should they exclude the islands from Article 5, the sources said, with one of them adding that Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe could go as far as announcing that the islands do not fall under Article 5. \r\nOther sources, however, think that \u201ca realistic scenario is that the prime minister shows his political will and seeks consent from the United States.\u201d \r\nAt the same time, \u201cRussia won\u2019t agree to hand over [the islands] unless the possibility of stationing the US military there is ruled out,\u201d a source familiar with the Japanese-Russian ties told The Japan Times over the weekend. \r\nNevertheless, convincing the US to okay such conditions seems very difficult, a Japanese government source said, adding that \u201cIt could even shake the foundations of the [Japan-US military] alliance.\u201d \r\nFor Russia, the area around the disputed islands is of \u201cextremely high importance\u201d because it faces the Sea of Okhotsk, a Japanese government source said, and a foreign military in these waters could hamper both essential military drills and the use of a major access route to the Pacific Ocean. \r\nTokyo has already rejected the report, saying they are not planning to review Article 5, TASS news agency said, citing Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida reiterated it, adding that the Japan-US treaty \u201capplies and will apply\u201d to all territories and waters which are administered by Japan. \r\nEarlier in the month, Tokyo also denied Nikkei\u2019s report that Japan and Russia were discussing joint administration of the Kuril Islands. \r\n\u201cThere is no change in Japan\u2019s fundamental position that Japan will conclude the peace treaty with Russia by resolving the issue of the possession of the four northern islands,\u201d Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman Yasuhira Kawamura told Reuters in an email at that time. \r\nRussia has always insisted that any change in the status of the islands is out of the question, as it would constitute a reassessment of the results of World War II, which is expressly banned by international treaties."

            "NATO Announces Largest Troop Deployments Against Russia Since Cold War By Alex Lantier\r\nNovember 09, 2016 \" Information Clearing House \" - \" WSWS \" - NATO will place hundreds of thousands of troops on alert for military action against Russia in the coming months, top NATO officials told the Times of London on Monday.\r\nThe US-led military alliance is planning to speed up the mobilization of forces numbering in the tens of thousands and, ultimately, hundreds of thousands and millions that are to be mobilized against Russia. Beyond its existing 5,000-strong emergency response force, NATO is tripling its \u0093incumbent response force\u0094 to 40,000 and putting hundreds of thousands of troops on higher alert levels.\r\nThe Times wrote, \u0093Sir Adam West, Britain\u0092s outgoing permanent representative to NATO, said he thought that the goal was to speed up the response time of up to 300,000 military personnel to about two months. At present a force of this size could take up to 180 days to deploy.\u0094\r\nNATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said, \u0093We are addressing what we call the follow-on forces. There are a large number of people in the armed forces of NATO allies. We are looking into how more of them can be ready on a shorter notice.\u0094 According to the Times , Stoltenberg explained that NATO is looking broadly at methods for \u0093improving the readiness of many of the alliance's three million soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines.\u0094\r\nThe target of these deployments, the largest since the dissolution of the Soviet Union by the Stalinist bureaucracy and the end of the Cold War a quarter century ago, is Russia.\r\n\u0093We have seen a more assertive Russia implementing a substantial military build-up of many years, tripling defence spending since 2000 in real terms; developing new military capabilities; exercising their forces and using military force against neighbours,\u0094 Stoltenberg said. \u0093We have also seen Russia using propaganda in Europe among NATO allies and that is exactly the reason why NATO is responding. We are responding with the biggest reinforcement of our collective defence since the end of the Cold War.\u0094\r\nThese statements show how NATO planning for a horrific war against Russia has continued behind the backs of the people throughout the US presidential election campaign. Military deployments and war preparations by the Pentagon and the general staffs of the various European countries are set to go ahead, moreover, whatever the outcome of the election in the United States and those slated for 2017 in the European NATO countries.\r\nStoltenberg's vague attack on Russian \u0093propaganda\u0094 in Europe is an allusion to the instinctive opposition to war that exists in the European and international working class and popular distrust of the anti-Russian propaganda promoted by NATO officials like Stoltenberg and West.\r\nLast year, a Pew poll found broad international opposition to NATO participation in a conventional war against Russia in Eastern Europe, even in a scenario that assumes Russia started the conflict. Under these hypothetical conditions, 58 percent of Germans, 53 percent of French people, and 51 percent of Italians opposed any military action against Russia. Opposition to war in the poll would doubtless have been higher had pollsters mentioned that NATO's decision to attack Russian forces in Eastern Europe could lead to nuclear war.\r\nThis opposition is rooted in deep disaffection with the imperialist Middle East wars of the post-Soviet period and the memory of two world wars in Europe in the 20th century. The arguments Stoltenberg presented against it are politically fraudulent.\r\nThe primary threat of military aggression and war in Europe comes not from Russia, but from the NATO countries. Over the past 25 years, the imperialist powers of NATO have bombed and invaded countries in Central Asia, the Middle East and Africa. Within Europe, they bombed Serbia and Kosovo in the Balkan Wars of the 1990s, pushed NATO\u0092s borders hundreds of miles to the East, and backed a violent, fascist-led putsch to topple a pro-Russian government in Ukraine in 2014.\r\nThe aggressive character of NATO policy emerged once again last Friday, when NBC News reported that US cyber warfare units had hacked key Russian electricity, Internet and military networks. These are now \u0093vulnerable to attack by secret American cyber weapons should the US deem it necessary,\u0094 NBC stated.\r\nRussian officials denounced the activities highlighted in the report and the Obama White House's silence on the matter. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said, \u0093If no official reaction from the American administration follows, it would mean state cyber terrorism exists in the US. If the threats of the attack, which were published by the US media, are carried out, Moscow would be justified in charging Washington.\u0094\r\nThe geo-strategically disastrous consequences of the Stalinist bureaucracy's dissolution of the Soviet Union and restoration of capitalism in Eastern Europe are ever more apparent. With NATO troops or proxy forces stationed in a geographic belt extending from the Baltic republics to Poland, Ukraine and Romania\u0097either a short distance from or on Russia's borders\u0097NATO is now poised for a major war against Russia that could escalate into a nuclear conflagration.\r\nAn examination of Stoltenberg\u0092s remarks shows that NATO\u0092s plans are not defensive preparations to counter a sudden conventional invasion of Europe by the Russian army. In such a scenario, Russian tank columns would overrun the few thousand or tens of thousands of troops in NATO\u0092s various emergency response forces, depriving the broader ranks of NATO \u0093follow-up\u0094 forces the 60 to 180 days they need to mobilize.\r\nRather, the plan for mobilizing successive layers of \u0093follow-on forces\u0094 is intended to allow NATO to threaten Russia in a crisis situation by gradually bringing to bear more and more of its collective military strength, which, although split between 28 member states, outweighs that of Russia. Russia's population of 145 million is far smaller than that of the NATO countries, at 906 million.\r\nThe aggressive character of NATO\u0092s agenda is illustrated by a report issued last month by the CIA-linked Rand Corporation think tank on the military situation in the Baltic republics of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. The small military forces NATO has posted in the Baltic republics, Rand wrote, are \u0093inviting a devastating war, rather than deterring it.\u0094 They calculated that Russian forces, if they actually invaded, could overrun these countries in approximately 60 hours.\r\nOn this basis, the think tank called for launching a vast NATO military build-up in the Baltic republics, virtually at the gates of St. Petersburg. It wrote that it would take \u0093a force of about seven brigades, including three heavy armored brigades\u0097adequately supported by air power, land-based fires, and other enablers on the ground and ready to fight at the onset of hostilities to prevent the rapid overrun of the Baltic states.\u0094 This would cost the NATO countries $2.7 billion each year.\r\nAs the NATO countries intensify their threats against Russia, there are increasingly bitter conflicts among the NATO imperialist powers themselves. Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi bluntly opposed new sanctions on Russia as called for by Washington at last month's European Union summit in Brussels, and there are deepening tensions between Germany and the United States as officials in Berlin and Paris call for an independent EU military.\r\nProspects of increased US-led military provocations against Russia are sharpening tensions within Europe. In an article titled \u0093Whether Clinton or Trump wins, for Germany things will get uncomfortable,\u0094 German news magazine Der Spiegel warned of the long-term implications of an aggressive US-led policy against Russia, which it assumed would continue regardless which of the two candidates secured the White House.\r\nThe magazine wrote, \u0093The motto will be: If you want (nuclear) US protection from Putin, you must either pay us more money or re-arm yourself.\u0094\r\nCopyright \u0160 1998-2016 World Socialist Web Site - All rights reserved"

            "Russia To Hit ISIS In Aleppo With Cruise Missiles 11/09/2016 \r\nDAILY MAIL The Russian navy is planning a massive attack on Aleppo within the next 24 hours, according to a Ministry of Defence source. A group of ships including an aircraft carrier, a nuclear power guided missile cruiser and two destroyers is reportedly ready to strike from the Mediterranean Sea. But the Russian source insisted the missiles will aim for areas surrounding Aleppo to avoid harming the 200,000 civilians still living there. \u2018The group\u2019s main goal is to carry out missile strikes on terrorists outside of Aleppo that are attempting to get into the city\u2019, they told Gazeta.ru . \u2018The strikes will avoid the city of Aleppo to prevent civilian casualties, because terrorists continue to use city residents as human shields.\u2019 The source added that the details of the strike are still being finalised as they navy zeros in on exact targets around the Syrian city. The strikes could apparently include Kalibr cruise missiles, launched from a submarine. The strikes could apparently include Kalibr cruise missiles, although these would be launched from a submarine Russian aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov is among the group in the Mediterranean Sea It comes on the day of the US election, after American officials have condemned Russia\u2019s bombing campaign in Syria. Secretary of state John Kerry has called on Russia, which supports dictator Bashar-al-Assad against rebel groups, to stop bombing civilians in what he described as the \u2018largest of humanitarian disasters\u2019. But President Putin has denied any \u2018war crimes\u2019 and asked for evidence that his forces are bombing innocents. Russian planes were allegedly responsible for a strike killing at least seven children and two pregnant women in Syria\u2019s rebel stronghold province of Idlib on Tuesday. \r\n+6 Russian planes were allegedly responsible for strikes killing at least seven children and two pregnant women in Syria\u2019s rebel stronghold province of Idlib on Tuesday The strike hit the town of Khan Sheikun in the south of the province, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitor said. The Britain-based group, which relies on a network of sources inside Syria for its information, says it determines what planes carried out raids according to their type, location, flight patterns and the munitions involved. In Moscow, the defence ministry denied that Russian aircraft had been in the area on Tuesday, and accused the Observatory of \u2018information provocations\u2019. Russia began its air campaign in support of the government in September 2015, saying it was targeting \u2018terrorists.\u2019 \u2018The strike hit a street where children were playing. Three of the dead children were from one family and were visiting their grandfather,\u2019 Observatory director Rami Abdel Rahman said."

            "Britain, U.S. sending planes, troops to deter Russia in the east 10/26/2016 \r\nREUTERS \r\nBritain said on Wednesday it will send fighter jets to Romania next year and the United States promised troops, tanks and artillery to Poland in NATO\u2019s biggest military build-up on Russia\u2019s borders since the Cold War. \r\nGermany, Canada and other NATO allies also pledged forces at a defense ministers meeting in Brussels on the same day two Russian warships armed with cruise missiles entered the Baltic Sea between Sweden and Denmark, underscoring East-West tensions. \r\nIn Madrid, the foreign ministry said Russia had withdrawn a request to refuel three warships in Spain\u2019s North African enclave of Ceuta after NATO allies said they could be used to target civilians in Syria. \r\nThe ships were part of an eight-ship carrier battle group \u2013 including Russia\u2019s sole aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov \u2013 that is expected to join around 10 other Russian vessels already off the Syrian coast, diplomats said. \r\nNATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said the troop contributions to a new 4,000-strong force in the Baltics and eastern Europe were a measured response to what the alliance believes are some 330,000 Russian troops stationed on Russia\u2019s western flank near Moscow. \r\n\u201cThis month alone, Russia has deployed nuclear-capable Iskander missiles to Kaliningrad and suspended a weapons-grade plutonium agreement with the United States,\u201d Stoltenberg said, also accusing Russia of continued support for rebels in Ukraine. \r\nThose ballistic missiles can hit targets across Poland and the Baltics, although NATO officials declined to say if Russia had moved nuclear warheads to Kaliningrad. \r\nNATO\u2019s aim is to make good on a July promise by NATO leaders to deter Russia in Europe\u2019s ex-Soviet states, after Moscow orchestrated the annexation of the Crimea peninsula in 2014. \r\nNATO\u2019s plan is to set up four battle groups with a total of some 4,000 troops from early next year, backed by a 40,000-strong rapid-reaction force, and if need be, follow-on forces. \r\nAs part of that, U.S. Secretary of Defense Ash Carter announced a \u201cbattle-ready battalion task force\u201d of about 900 soldiers would be sent to eastern Poland, as well as another, separate force equipped with tanks and other heavy equipment to move across eastern Europe. \r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a major sign of the U.S. commitment to strengthening deterrence here,\u201d Carter said. \r\nBritain\u2019s Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said Britain would send an 800-strong battalion to Estonia, supported by French and Danish troops, starting from May. The United States wants its troops in position by June. \r\nLondon is also sending Typhoon fighter aircraft to Romania to patrol around the Black Sea, partly in support of Turkey. \r\n\u201cAlthough we are leaving the European Union, we will be doing more to help secure the eastern and southern flanks of NATO,\u201d Fallon said. \r\nSYRIAN SHADOW \r\nOthers NATO allies joined the four battle groups led by the United States, Germany, Britain and Canada to go to Poland, Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia. Canada said it was sending 450 troops to Latvia, joined by 140 military personnel from Italy. \r\nGermany said it was sending between 400 and 600 troops to Lithuania, with additional forces from the Netherlands, Norway, Belgium, Croatia and Luxembourg. \r\nStoltenberg said allies\u2019 commitments would be \u201ca clear demonstration of our transatlantic bond.\u201d Diplomats said it would also send a message to Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, who has complained that European allies do not pay their way in the alliance. \r\nFor the Kremlin, the U.S.-led alliance\u2019s plans are already too much given Russia\u2019s grievances at NATO\u2019s expansion eastwards, although Stoltenberg denied going too far. \r\nBut NATO\u2019s troop announcements in the Baltic states and Poland were partly overshadowed by the dispute about whether Spain should refuel the Russian warships, which was later resolved by Moscow\u2019s decision to withdraw its request. \r\nNATO\u2019s tensions with Russia have been building since Crimea and the West\u2019s decision to impose retaliatory sanctions. \r\nBut the breakdown of a U.S-Russia brokered ceasefire in Syria on Oct. 3, followed by U.S. accusations that Russia has used cyber attacks to disrupt the presidential election, have signaled a worsening of ties. \r\nEven before the break down of the Syrian ceasefire, Russian President Vladimir Putin suspended a treaty with Washington on cleaning up weapons-grade plutonium, signaling he was willing to use nuclear disarmament as a new bargaining chip in disputes with the United States over Ukraine and Syria. \r\n(Additional reporting by Sabine Siebold; Editing by Tom Heneghan)"

            "FBI sees no ties between Trump, Putin 11/01/2016 \r\nPRESS TV \r\nThe US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has found no clear links between Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and Russia, officials say, proving false allegations by the candidate\u2019s Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. \r\nThe FBI spent most of the summer to verify claims by the Clinton campaign that Trump was linked to President Vladimir Putin, and Moscow was trying to influence the November 8 vote in his favor. \r\nHowever, the bureau failed to find any indications of the alleged ties after scrutinizing advisors close to Trump, investigating the real estate mogul\u2019s financial ties and even his emails, the New York Times reported Tuesday, citing law enforcement officials. \r\nClinton\u2019s campaign voiced concerns about Moscow\u2019s intervention after a series of emails belonging to various ranks of the Democratic Party were released by the anti-secrecy website Wikileaks. \r\nAmerican intelligence officials blamed the hacks on Russia and even threatened to come up with countermeasures of the same nature. President Barack Obama and high-ranking officials in his administration also blamed Russia for the breaches. \r\nUnder immense pressure from Clinton\u2019s supporters, who were mad at Trump for calling Putin a great leader, the FBI started its investigation into the claims. \r\nThe Clinton campaign has called on the FBI to publicly discuss their findings about the case, as they did with their new investigation into Clinton\u2019s new emails. \r\nFBI chief James Comey told Congress on Friday that he was reopening investigations into Clinton\u2019s emails after finding a trove of new emails on a laptop belonging to former representative Anthony Weiner, who was once married to Clinton\u2019s top aide Huma Abedin. \r\nAt some point during its investigation, the FBI questioned Paul Manafort, Trump\u2019s former campaign boss, who has reportedly had extensive business ties in Russia and other former Soviet states, especially Ukraine, the Times noted. \r\nThe bureau\u2019s agents also investigated an email channel between Trump and the Alfa Bank, one of Russia\u2019s biggest banks. \r\nAfter weeks of detailed investigation, the FBI concluded that the connection was nothing more than marketing emails or spam \r\nTrump has rejected Clinton\u2019s allegations against Russia, and has pledged to work with Moscow and earn Putin\u2019s respect."

            "Half Of Russians Fear Syria Could Spark WW3 11/02/2016 \r\nRUSSIA TODAY Almost half of all respondents in a recent Russian opinion poll said they feared that the aggravation of relations between Russia and the West caused by the ongoing crisis in Syria could develop into a global military conflict. \r\nThe share of those who see the probability of World War Three in the near future as high or very high is now at 48 percent and those who appraise it as low or very low comprise 42 percent of society, the privately-owned public opinion research center Levada reported on Monday. The remaining 10 percent of respondents said they couldn\u2019t give a simple answer to the question. \r\nWhen researchers asked citizens if they considered it possible that Russia and the West would eventually find a mutually acceptable solution to the crisis, 35 percent answered that this scenario was likely or very likely. Thirty-nine percent evaluate the probability of such an outcome as low or very low and 26 percent said that they couldn\u2019t answer the question. \r\nJust over half \u2013 52 percent \u2013 of Russians said they approve of their country\u2019s involvement in the Syrian conflict and 26 percent said they had a negative or sharply negative attitude to this. Just under a quarter \u2013 23 percent \u2013 couldn\u2019t answer the question about their personal view on the subject. Those who thought that Russia should continue the operation and those who thought that airstrikes should be stopped were divided 49 percent against 28 percent respectively, with 24 percent finding the question too difficult to answer. \r\nThe level of awareness about the situation in Syria and the Russian Air Force operation against Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL) terrorists there remained fairly high. Eighteen percent said they were very closely following developments in Syria and 64 percent revealed partial familiarity with the issue. Just under a fifth \u2013 17 percent \u2013 said that they were not interested in news about Syria. \r\nA similar poll conducted a year ago by the independent Levada Center showed that over 70 percent of Russian citizens supported the air operations against IS terrorists in Syria, and almost a half of them agreed that it was right for Russia to support the government of Syria\u2019s democratically-elected President Bashar Assad. \r\nA different poll conducted earlier this month by the state-run research center VTSIOM showed that 73 percent of Russians believed that Western criticism of the air force\u2019s counter-terrorism operation in Aleppo, Syria, was ungrounded and prejudiced. Only 6 percent said the allegations of wrongdoing on the part of the Russian military have some basis in reality. \r\nRussia first deployed an air force contingent in Syria in 2015, after receiving a request for military help from the Syrian government, which is currently battling Islamic State and affiliated groups. Russian war planes began launching airstrikes on terrorists in Syria on September 30, 2015. Their work has aided the Syrian military in achieving considerable success in driving jihadist forces out of the country."

Despite the fact that blocs which opposed NATO no longer exist, it\u2019s impossible to change the alliance\u2019s \u201c aggressive nature \u201d due to its ideological and political bases. \r\nEarlier on Monday, the Times published a report suggesting that \u201c hundreds of thousands of NATO troops will be put on a higher state of alert amid growing tensions with Russia .\u201d According to the British daily \u2013 which cites the alliance\u2019s secretary-general, Jens Stoltenberg, and the UK\u2019s outgoing permanent representative to the bloc, Adam Thomson \u2013 NATO aims to largely speed up the time its troops can be deployed. \r\nIt reportedly aims to have up to 300,000 military personnel from nations across the alliance at the ready, having shortened their response time to about two months, compared to the current 180 days. \r\n\u201c We are responding with the biggest reinforcement of our collective defense since the end of the Cold War ,\u201d Stoltenberg told the Times . The bloc is looking into how more of its 3 million personnel \u201c can be ready on a shorter notice ,\u201d he added, saying that NATO defense ministers have already had discussions on the issue. \r\nHaving accused Moscow of \u201c assertive \u201d behavior, the NATO chief said Russia had increased its defense spending and was \u201c developing new military capabilities .\u201d \r\n\u201c In regard to its national security, Russia acts within its national borders, undoubtedly posing no threat to anyone ,\u201d Peskov said, commenting on Stoltenberg\u2019s statements. The way the military bloc has reacted \u201c once again shows the organization\u2019s aggressive nature ,\u201d he added."

            "Russia and NATO hold war games next to each other 11/01/2016 \r\nEXPRESS Around 680 troops from 32 NATO states and partner countries \u2013 including Israel and Ukraine \u2013 have been carrying out drills in Montenegro since Monday. Joint exercises codenamed Crna Gora 2016 are taking places until November 4 testing Western allies responses to a number of disaster scenarios, including floods and chemical spills. At the same time, a few miles over the border in Serbia 150 paratroopers from Russian Airborne Troops will be conducting drills from November 2 for two weeks. The exercises will see hundreds of heavily-armed and battle-ready Russian and NATO troops placed within a few hundreds miles of each. Montenegro\u2019s Deputy Prime Minister Dusko Markovic said: \u201cThis is an opportunity to work with NATO during the four-day exercise to determine our capacity and the capabilities of our response to natural disasters, as well as to recognise our weaknesses and eliminate them in time. \u201cMontenegro has demonstrated the ability as a future member of NATO, not only through organising this exercise, but also bearing its burden. \u201cMontenegro has demonstrated the ability to not only willing to accept but also help realise partnership goals.\u201d Slavic Brotherhood 2016 will involve Russian troops and Serbian and Belarusian forces. Fifty soldiers from the Russian Military Transport Aviation will take part along with combat vehicles, all-terrain vehicles and drones. Aleksandr Grushko, Russia\u2019s NATO Representative, said of the latest drills: \u201cNATO\u2019s efforts have been changing the very essence of the military security in the regions which are adjacent to the Russian border. \r\nRussian troops on exercise \r\nAround 680 troops from 32 NATO states and partner countries are taking part \r\nMap of Serbia and Montenegro, where the exercises are taking part \u201cThis seriously worsens the regional security and the security of those countries that participate in these drills and this activity. \u201cI think it\u2019s a double signal. First of all, it\u2019s a signal to western public opinion that all NATO actions on its eastern flank are calibrated and do not transcend the framework of reasonable defence. \u201cSecondly, it\u2019s also an apparent attempt to send a signal to us, so that Russia will not react in what they believe to be an excessive and aggressive manner.\u201d"

            "Assad: US waging proxy war in Syria against Russia & Iran 11/03/2016 \r\nBLACKLISTEDNEWS.COM Despite claiming humanitarian motives, US actions in Syria are meant to undermine the power of Russia and Iran, with Washington trying to achieve this goal by directly supporting terrorists, Syrian President Bashar Assad has said. The US\u2019 secret collaboration with terrorists is the reason why all attempts at a ceasefire and political transition in Syria have so far failed, the Syrian leader told Serbian newspaper Politika. The interview was also published by the Syria\u2019s SANA news agency.\r\n\u201cSupporting the terrorists is a war of attrition against Syria, against Iran, against Russia, that\u2019s how they look at it. That\u2019s why not only this ceasefire \u2013 every attempt regarding ceasefire or political moving or political initiative, every failure of these things, the United States was to blame,\u201d the Syrian president said. \r\nAssad was referring to the deal negotiated by the US and Russia in September, which it was hoped would pave the way for a lasting truce in Syria. In practice, the agreement was derailed by armed groups, which had rejected it from the very beginning. The US pledged to convince the so-called moderate opposition to stick to the bargain and separate from terrorists, who would then be legitimate targets for a joint Russian-American air campaign. Washington didn\u2019t deliver on this promise, however. \r\nAccording to the Syrian president, a lasting ceasefire was not what Washington sought from the deal in the first place. \r\n\u201cThey always ask for ceasefire only when the terrorists are in a bad situation, not for the civilians. And they try to use those ceasefires in order to support the terrorists, bring them logistic support, armament, money, everything, in order to re-attack and to become stronger again,\u201d he said. \r\nSometimes the US support for terrorist groups goes through its allies such as Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Qatar, Assad believes, while occasionally they provide direct support even to Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL), a group that the Washington-led coalition was supposedly formed to defeat. An example of this came during an American attack on Syrian Army troops near Deir Ez-Zor, which happened while the US-Russian truce was in force, and which the US claimed was the result of a mistake. \r\n\u201cThey attacked a very big area. They didn\u2019t attack a building to say, \u2018we made a mistake.\u2019 They attacked three big hills, not other groups neighboring these hills,\u201d he said. \u201cIn less than one hour, ISIS attacked those hills. It means that ISIS gathered their forces to attack those hills. How did ISIS know that the Americans would attack that Syrian position? It means they were ready, they were prepared.\u201d \r\nHumanitarian mask, like in Yugoslavia, Afghanistan or Iraq Western media are currently focusing on civilian suffering in Syria and alleged atrocities committed by the Syrian government and its allies to justify deeper involvement in the war by whatever means the White House chooses, Assad said in the interview. \r\n\u201cYou have a black-and-white picture; very, very bad guy against very, very good guy. It\u2019s like the narrative of George W. Bush during the war on Iraq and on Afghanistan,\u201d he described. \r\n\u201cThe war in your country has been portrayed in the same way; as a humanitarian war where the West wanted to intervene in order to protect a certain community against the aggressors from the other community,\u201d Assad said, referring to the Balkan Wars and the partitioning of Yugoslavia. \u201cSo, many people in the world believe that story, the same in Syria; they use the same mask, the humanitarian mask.\u201d \r\nWhile stressing any wrongdoing on the part of the government forces, the West ignores whatever atrocities the opposition commits, the president said. \r\n\u201cThe terrorists killed during the last three days more than 80 innocent civilians in Aleppo, and wounded more than 300. You don\u2019t read anything about them in the Western mainstream media,\u201d he said. \u201cThey only single out some pictures and some incidents in the area under the control of the terrorists just to use them for their political agenda in order to condemn and to blame the Syrian government, not because they are worried about the Syrians.\u201d \r\n\u201cThey don\u2019t care about our children, or about innocents, and about civilization, about infrastructure,\u201d he added. \u201cBut actually, they only care about using everything that would serve their vested interests.\u201d \r\nThe Syrian president doesn\u2019t expect the US approach to Syria to change, regardless of who wins the presidential election next week, he told the newspaper. Both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump would be bad for his country, he said. \r\n\u201cWe don\u2019t see any good signs that the United States is going to change dramatically its policy toward what\u2019s happening in the world\u2026 or to obey the international law, or to care about the United Nation\u2019s Charter,\u201d he said. \r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about who\u2019s going to be president; the difference will be very minimal, each one of them is going to be allowed to leave his own fingerprint, just personal fingerprint, but doesn\u2019t mean change of policies. That\u2019s why we don\u2019t pin our hopes, we don\u2019t waste our time with it.\u201d \r\nA year without interference to stop war Assad reiterated his assessment that if Syria were left to settle its problems without foreign interference, it would take it no more than a year to end the conflict, saying that \u201cit is not very complicated internally.\u201d \r\n\u201cOf course, that looks not realistic, because everybody knows that the United States wanted to undermine the position of Russia as a great power in the world, including in Syria. Saudi Arabia has been looking how to destroy Iran for years now, and Syria could be one of the places where they can achieve that, according to their way of thinking,\u201d he said. \r\n\u201cBut if we say that we could achieve that situation where all those foreign powers leave Syria alone, we don\u2019t have a problem in solving our problem.\u201d \r\nThe president said Syria has existed as a multiethnic multiconfessional entity for centuries and has significant experience in overcoming differences. \r\n\u201cWithout all different colors of the society \u2013 Christians, Muslims, and the different sects and ethnicities \u2013 you won\u2019t have Syria. So, every Syrian citizen should feel fully free in practicing his rituals, his traditions, his beliefs. He should be free in order to have a stable country. Otherwise you won\u2019t have Syria as a stable country,\u201d Assad said. \r\nThe war has been a huge ordeal for Syrian society, but it has made Syrians as a nation more united, not less, he added. \r\n\u201cMany Syrians before the war didn\u2019t tell the difference between being fanatic and being extremist, between being extremist and being terrorist. Those borders weren\u2019t clear for many,\u201d the president said. \u201cBecause of the war, because of the destruction, because of the heavy price that affected every Syrian, many Syrians learned the lesson and now they know that the only way to protect the country and to preserve the country is to be homogenous, to live with each other, to integrate, to accept, to love each other.\u201d \r\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I think the effect of the war, in spite of all the bad aspects of any war like this war, but this aspect was positive for the Syrian society. So, I\u2019m not worried about the structure of Syrian society after the war. I think it\u2019s going to be healthier,\u201d Assad added."

            "US Military Prepares To Shut Down Russia\u2019s Internet If It Hacks The Election 11/08/2016 \r\nDAILY CALLER \r\nAmerican hackers recently broke into Russia\u2019s communications networks, electrical grid and government systems in preparation for a retaliatory cyber strike should Russian hackers meddle in the U.S. election, according to NBC News. \r\nOfficials do not expect any major attacks on U.S. infrastructure, which would be tantamount to an act of war, but they are concerned that Russian hackers may meddle in the election by spreading false information. The hacker \u201cGuccifer 2.0\u201d \u2014 which officials and some cyber security experts believe is a front for Russian intelligence \u2014 claimed they would be monitoring elections \u201cfrom inside the system.\u201d \r\nThe U.S. preparations are no different than Russia and China\u2019s probing of U.S. networks. The penetration caused no damage to Russia, instead it was the equivalent of a military scouting mission. Cyber weapons could be deployed if the U.S. suffered a significant attack, but officials tell NBC News that is an unlikely scenario. Just to be sure though, Obama administration officials issued a back-channel warning to Russia to stay out of the election. \r\n\u201cYou\u2019d gain access to a network, you\u2019d establish your presence on the network and then you\u2019re poised to do what you would like to do with the network,\u201d Gary Brown, a former legal adviser to U.S. Cyber Command (CYBERCOM), told NBC News. \r\nU.S. cyber capabilities are top of the line, but the Obama administration has been wary of deploying them, despite consistent Russian provocation. CYBERCOM and the National Security Agency, the agencies responsible for U.S. cyber security, are incredibly secretive regarding U.S. capabilities. Stuxnet is the most well-known, publicized U.S. cyber weapon. The highly advanced computer worm wreaked havoc on Iran\u2019s nuclear enrichment program in 2010. \r\nCYBERCOM is currently involved in cyber attacks against the Islamic State, but Pentagon officials have been especially silent on the exact details of the \u201c cyber bombs \u201d being dropped on the terrorist group. Russia may find itself the next target, should it decide to go from misinformation campaigns to attacks on infrastructure."

            "NATO fighter jets on constant watch for Russian jets above Baltic states 11/08/2016 \r\nDAILY MAIL Russian fighter jets are constantly probing Nato\u2019s defences over the Baltic states, with more than 600 \u2018interceptions\u2019 so far this year. Ironically, considering the history, the Nato pilots defending the skies over Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania are often German. Seven German fighter pilots are based at an air base at Amari, west of the Estonian capital Tallinn. Lieutenant Colonel Swen Jacob, the commander of the German pilots, said they often flew as close as 10 yards from the Russian jets and one occasion a Russian pilot gave him a middle-fingered salute. Lt Col Jacob joked to the Washington Post : \u2018Maybe he watched too much \u201cTop Gun\u201d.\u2019 But the situation in the Baltic is deadly serious, with the Russian air force clearly under orders from President Vladimir Putin to be more aggressive in the air. An RAF Eurofighter Typhoon plane takes off over a field of poppies. German Typhoons are currently based in Amari, Estonia, and it is possible they will be replaced by British Typhoons in January The Typhoon jet (left) is flown by the German air force and the RAF aswell as the Italian and Spanish air forces. It is matched in the air with the Russian Sukhoi SU-27 Flanker (right) The German pilots have scrambled 34 times since they were posted in Estonia on August 31, with Sukhoi SU-27 Flanker jets the most common threat. The Russian planes are free to fly along an international airspace corridor running between St Petersburg and the Kaliningrad enclave and west as far as the Danish island of Falster. Russian pilots often fly without transponders, making them virtually invisible and increasing the danger of mid-air collisions. Lt Col Jacob told the Post: \u2018The fighter aircraft are almost always armed to the teeth. Six kinds of missiles. They could carry up to 10.\u2019 This Sukhoi SU-27 Flanker showed off its abilities at the Farnborough air show a few years ago, before the icy blasts of the new cold war descended on Europe The Flanker\u2019s full armoury includes Vympel R-27, R-73 and R-77 air-to-air missiles, Zvezda Kh-35U anti-ship missiles, S-8 and S-13 rockets and a collection of guided bombs and cluster bombs. The French air force also has four fighter jets based at \u0160iauliai in Lithuania. Both the French and German contingents are due to be rotated out of the area in January and replaced by other Nato pilots, including possibly RAF pilots from Britain. \r\n+20 Goodybe Mr President: Russia\u2019s President Putin (left) has massively increased Russian military spending and anti-Western rhetoric and most experts agree he has outmanouevred President Obama (right) militarily and politically The Baltic states seized their independence from the collapsing Soviet Union in 1991 and, increasingly worried about the Russian bear on their doorstep, joined Nato in 2004. Putin was enraged that Nato was within 100 miles of Russia\u2019s second city, St Petersburg, and in the last year he has been increasingly probing Nato\u2019s defences in the region. Yesterday Nato chiefs announced plans to put together a force of 300,000 troops which they can put on \u2018high alert\u2019 in eastern Europe. Relations between Russia and the West have plunged in the last year, with Moscow\u2019s insistence on backing its Syrian ally, President Bashar al-Assad, at all costs leading to serious tension with the US, Britain and France. Most Nato members cut their defence spending dramatically since the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991 but Russia has been bolstering its military capabilities, holding parades involving more than 100,000 troops each year. \r\n+20 Nato soldiers stand on a pontoon bridge constructed across the Vistula river in Poland during the NATO Anaconda-16 exercise earlier this year Moscow has been throwing its weight around in recent years \u2013 in 2008 Russian troops humiliated the Georgians and in turn the White House by invading South Ossetia and Abkhazia in support of pro-Moscow rebels. Then in 2014 Russia annexed Crimea and supported ethnic Russian rebels in the eastern Ukraine. President Obama\u2019s \u2018Russian reset\u2019 policy, which was designed to improve relations with Moscow, has looked increasingly like a policy of appeasement. \r\n+20 At the weekend Russian soldiers, dressed in World War Two era uniforms, commemorate the 75th anniversary of a famous parade in 1941 when the Red Army headed out of Moscow to take on the Nazis Russia\u2019s President Vladimir Putin has been accused of attempting to interfere with the US election process by hacking into the emails of senior members of the Democratic party and recently moved the Iskander nuclear-capable missiles into the Kaliningrad enclave, on the borders with Poland. But Nato members like Estonia, Poland and Romania, who are feeling increasingly threatened by Moscow, are now being promised a rapid deployment force. Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg told The Times this week: \u2018We have also seen Russia using propaganda in Europe among Nato allies and that is exactly the reason why Nato is responding. We are responding with the biggest reinforcement of our collective defence since the end of the Cold War. \u2018We have seen Russia being much more active in many different ways. \u2018We have seen a more assertive Russia implementing a substantial military build-up over many years; tripling defence spending since 2000 in real terms; developing new military capabilities; exercising their forces and using military force against neighbours,\u2019 added Mr Stoltenberg. \r\n+20 Russia recently moved its nuclear-capable Iskander missiles into the Kaliningrad enclave. The missiles could take out targets in Berlin Britain\u2019s permanent representative to Nato, Sir Adam Thomson, told The Times it would currently take Nato six months to deploy a force of 300,000, which was simply too slow. At the weekend British military intelligence officers issued a warning over a new Russian \u2018super tank\u2019 which they claim is far superior to anything which is available to Nato. The document claims that Britain\u2019s Challenger II main battle tank could be overpowered by the Kremlin\u2019s new Armata tank. Officials believe the new Russian tank is \u2018revolutionary\u2019 and blames the government for failing to provide a proper response. The new tank has several highly advanced features including an un-manned turret which makes the machine safer for crews Yesterday\u2019s military parade in Red Square commemorated a pivotal moment in World War Two when German forces were turned back from the gates of Moscow"
