            "Wednesday 9 November 2016 by Davywavy Vladimir Putin declares victory in US Presidential elections \nVladimir Putin has been elected the 45th President of the United Stares after a stunning victory last night. \nPutin, who was a surprise contender when he entered the race last year, consistently outperformed expectations outpolling all challengers and besting his competition in debates. \nPutin has announced that he will run the United States through a proxy as he is much too busy running the far more important country of Russia. \nIn a shock victory, American voters showed they were prepared to overlook Putin\u2019s history of running the KGB in favour of his perceived strong leadership and no-nonsense attitude. \nDoubts over his economic record were also waved aside, with uncomfortable facts such as Russian GDP halving in the last three years being dismissed as scaremongering. \n\u201cYou fellow Americans,\u201d said Putin in his acceptance speech. \n\u201cI have so many people to thank for my victory; Edward Snowden, Julian Assange, Bradley Manning, but not least of all the Democratic Party, who put up the only candidate even I could beat. \n\u201cOh, and I mustn\u2019t forget to congratulate myself too for putting the whole thing together. \n\u201cGod bless America,\u201d he added with a smile.

            "US Presidential Elections Sound a Warning of Catastrophes to Come By Daily Bell Staff - November 08, 2016 \nWhat\u2019s wrong with Hillary Clinton\u2019s brand? \u2026 As momentous an occasion as this should be for women around the world, Ms. Clinton would begin her term in the Oval Office with her unpopularity ratings at near-record levels. All of which leads to the question: What\u2019s wrong with Brand Hillary? \u2013 The Globe and Mail \nIn the run-up to today\u2019s election, many articles on Hillary in the mainstream media have tried to explain more fully why Hillary is electable and desirable as the leader of the US. \nA common theme of these articles is that Hillary\u2019s troubles are not mentioned or analyzed in detail. The Economist magazine, like many other publications, recently came out with an endorsement of Hillary. \nBut the endorsement simply dealt with Hillary\u2019s legislative and professional history. As always when it comes to Hillary in the mainstream media, deeper questions are glossed over. \nThis approach to covering Hillary is deliberate and has generated increasing skepticism among large portions of the American public. Correctly, alternative media reports have pointed out this declining credibility but not enough have explained its widening ramifications. \nMore: \nMs. Clinton is one of the most qualified presidential candidates in recent memory \u2013 and her credentials are that much more impressive compared to those of her opponent. \nAfter her time as first lady \u2013 in the state of Arkansas, and in the White House \u2013 Ms. Clinton served her country as a U.S. Senator and as secretary of state. \nThe article goes on to ask why Hillary has not been \u201cable to break through in a way that inspires fervent support and popularity.\u201d \nAt this point a significant analysis would grapple with underlying issues regarding Hillary\u2019s background and approach to politics and life. These issues are well known. But instead, these issues are presented as \u201cmultiple scandals, ranging from Lewinsky to Benghazi, and most recently, her e-mails.\u201d \nThe use of the word \u201cscandal\u201d implies something embarrassing. The significance of these problems in her personal and professional life goes far beyond embarrassment. It illustrates her approach to the US political system and generally how she wields power. \nHaving skipped past this analysis, the article then minimizes the scandals themselves, stating, \u201dAny politician who has been in the game that long has their fair share of scandal.\u201d \nThe article continues to evolve toward ephemera, suggesting that a big problem with Ms. Clinton is her inability to \u201cappear likable to voters.\u201d This is a political problem to be sure, but it is not the UNDERLYING problem, which is much more significant. \nFinally, the article brings up the idea that a big reason for the disconnect between Hillary and voters has to do with her gender. \u201cAs disheartening as that still is, society and the media still stereotype women and paint them with a negative brush.\u201d \nThe article explains that much criticism of Hillary is gender-related. She has been scrutinized because of her health problems and has too-often been seen by the media as a wife and mother rather than as a businesslike politician with a long, professional history. \nAs stated, articles like this are at variance with what many believe to be true. Hillary is seen, at this point, by tens of millions as a person with an extremely shady past who may be part of a larger political mafia with her husband that deals in extortion, cover-ups, drug-dealing and even murder to generate vast profits for their Clinton Foundation, and thus for themselves. \nSince this information is so widely dispersed, articles that don\u2019t deal more directly with these issues can be seen either as painfully naive or as concealing something. It is one of the reasons that trust in the mainstream media has plunged so precipitously. \nAdditionally, as we pointed out recently, belief in \u201cconspiracy theories,\u201d has risen to over 50 percent. Hillary\u2019s campaign and its coverage may be directly responsible. Once people were increasingly and regularly exposed to the disconnect between what they believed about Hillary and what was being presented, they began to reexamine various \u201cconspiracy\u201d reports they\u2019d previously discounted. \nEven among those voting for Hillary, there is widespread sentiment that she may have committed criminal wrongdoings and deserves a trial rather than the presidency. \nWe\u2019ve advanced the idea that none of this has come about by accident, not the FBI fumblings, nor reports of her healthcare problems, nor even the email \u201cscandals.\u201d All of this in fact was known well in advance of her latest presidential run. \nThis is simply not a coincidence in our view. The idea, increasingly it seems, is to shatter cultural cohesion in the West with an eye toward creating increased globalization and an internationalized society. This presidential election and its mainstream coverage has done just that. \nGoing forward, it is probable that cultural destruction will be increasingly significant throughout the West, employing numerous strategies \u2013 political, ethnic, economic and military. \nThese elections \u2013 whether Hillary wins or Trump \u2013 are evidently the starting gun, along with the European immigrant crisis, for a new series of elite programs. These will likely yield up serial catastrophes that will change lives and belief structures going forward for millions and even billions \nConclusion: Building an international world, whether the effort is to be successful or not, is a massive and horribly disruptive and bloody prospect. Americans would be wise to perceive this latest presidential elections as a kind of warning of what it is to come."

            "Email \nBev Harris, elections expert and founder of Black Box Voting, believes our elections are vulnerable to wholesale fraud via manipulation of vote totals in the centralized computer databases. She recently appeared on the Alex Jones Show, where she demonstrated a computer script named Fraction Magic that can alter vote totals all the way down to the precinct level and make the final vote totals add up to a desired result. \nFraction Magic was written by Bennie Smith, a computer professional from Memphis, Tennessee. He demonstrated how it works by entering a desired outcome in an overlay and then he and Bev Harris watched as Fraction Magic altered all the precinct totals and recalculated all the subtotals up to the final totals Bennie Smith had specified. He added, \u201cYou can create plausible results that really pass off as the real thing.\u201d \nHarris reported that she tested Fraction Magic on her copy of the database of all votes cast in the general election in Alaska in 2004. She fed in desired outcomes and Fraction Magic performed the necessary vote count alterations all the way down to the precinct level in four seconds. \nBoth Harris and Smith expressed concern about the number of people who have the necessary access level to the vote totals databases. They would include numerous IT people, vendors, consultants, technicians, and others. Election officials rarely, if ever, make public lists of names of people who have privileged access to the election databases. \nAn extremely disturbing trend in American elections is the recent use of encryption to keep precinct totals secret until after they are in the hands of centralized elections offices. The American people are being told this is secure transmission and modernization. The spin in the news media has been to marvel at the skillful technology. But not enough people are asking what benefit we are achieving by concealing public information from the public . \nConcealing precinct vote totals from the public until reviewed centrally was one of the tactics used by Hitler and Stalin. That\u2019s how they had the ability to alter vote totals without being caught. No one but a few insiders had any election totals until the centralized authority had the ability to rework the numbers if necessary to achieve their desired results and then release election results. \nThe term \"wholesale election fraud\" refers to one act by a fraudster that changes a large number of votes, such as in a computer, or alters the vote totals hoping no one will audit the results and verify the totals. \"Retail election fraud\" refers to cheating one vote at a time, such as when people cast multiple absentee ballots or vote multiple times in person in an election. These people are known in the trade as \"repeaters,\" and their ability to repeat vote is greatly enhanced both by early voting and by either lax enforcement of voter ID laws or no voter ID requirement. \nSpecifying a vote total or percentage and then working it down is not a new form of corruption in American politics. Tracy Campbell described how political boss George Parr operated in his book Deliver the Vote : Parr\u2019s aide and feared enforcer, Luis Salas, later related how the Parr machine ruled: \u201cParr was the Godfather. He had life or death control. We could tell any election judge, \u2018Give us 80 percent of the vote and the other guy 20 percent.' We had it made in every election.\u201d \nCampbell also described how another 200 votes appeared after Lyndon Johnson issued the order to \u201cfind the votes\u201d when he needed them to win the senate runoff election in Texas in 1948. \nIn Precinct Number 13, the precinct of Luis Salas, where he had manufactured a vote for Johnson of 765 to 60, the tally was now different. When one of the committee members read the totals for the precinct of Salas, the new total was 965 to 60. In the interim, obviously, one of Parr\u2019s men had simply taken a pen and closed the top loop of the \u201c7\u201d to create a \u201c9\u201d. \nBecause the precinct totals were public information, were reported immediately, and were obtained by Governor Coke Stevenson right away, he was able to identify the precinct where the extra 200 votes were added. Unfortunately, too many people in positions of power were on Johnson\u2019s side. \nThe concept behind Fraction Magic is not new to politics. What is different is the scale to which it can enable specifying an election result and make the subtotals match. \nThe fact that a program such as Fraction Magic can do what it does should be a wake-up call for the way we conduct our elections. We need to return to our traditional constitutionally correct decentralized counting of votes at the precinct level. We need a paper trail in the voting equipment. We must allow public access to any member of the public who wishes to observe the vote counts. And we must make precinct totals public immediately after the votes are counted, including posting them on the door of the voting site building. \nIf we do not, we run the risk of having our election results altered by the very people we hire to ensure that our elections are honest and accurate."

Arnoldski - \n\n\nThe US Federal Bureau of Investigation has directly pressured Russian diplomats and forbid them from being near voting places during the presidential elections in the United States on November 8th. Maria Zakharova, the spokeswoman of the Russian foreign ministry, wrote about this on her Facebook page on Monday. \n\u201cIt\u2019s come to openly intimidating the staff of diplomatic agencies. The State Department recommended Russian representatives in a memo \u2018not to come to polling stations on their own\u2019, and some states\u2019 authorities have gone even further and threatened criminal prosecution. This means that they can\u2019t even watch the voting procedure,\u201d Zakharova wrote. \nAccording to Zakharova, in recent days, direct pressure has been put on Russian representatives in the United States by the FBI, \u201cwhose agents, with undisguised threats, have let us know that we should not be interested in the American elections.\u201d \n\u201cIn Houston, in order to offer such a \u2018warning,\u2019 a Hollywood-style special operation was arranged that blocked the car of our Consulate General\u2019s employees on the street. They stopped the car and started to \u2018convince\u2019 them that they should not watch the voting, and not even think about it,\u201d Zakharova added. \n\nIn connection with the incident with the Russian embassy in Washington, a relevant submission has already been made to the State Department.  \n\u201cBut the question arises: what can a foreign diplomat see at American polling stations that is so important that they\u2019ve brought in \u2018Mr. Smith\u2019, and why are election monitoring procedures controlled by the FBI?!\u201d, the Russian foreign ministry\u2019s representative concluded.  \n\n     Follow us on Facebook!                                                   \n                                                   \n\n       Follow us on Twitter! \n                               \n\n             Donate!"

Our president was clear: the Russian Federation is not interfering in or even making any attempts to influence the will of the American people. In my opinion, the elections were held with numerous violations. If this had happened in Crimea or Russia, then the elections would have been assessed differently by American politicians. They would say that everything was wrong and illegitimate. But the Americans did not allow Russian diplomats near polling stations and prevented the formation of an objective view of what was happening at polling stations and overall how the elections were being held in the US.\u201d \nCommenting on Trump\u2019s pre-election promises in regards to Russia and the Republic of Crimea, Aksenov said: \u201cBefore elections, politicians usually make some statements, and then their program can radically change. Time will tell. I am sure that our president will make sufficient efforts so that Crimea will be recognized throughout the world.\u201d \nThis summer, Trump stated that he would be ready to \u201clook into\u201d the question of recognizing Crimea as Russian territory and lifting the sanctions against Russia if he won the elections. He remarked that Crimeans want to be with Russia and that this should be considered by the international community. These words caused great anxiety in Kiev. \n\nThe leader of the Donetsk People\u2019s Republic, Alexander Zakharchenko, was cautious in being optimistic towards Trump\u2019s election as US president. Zakharchenko expressed concern that after Trump moves into the White House, he will become part of the American political system and there is no guarantee that he will be able to resist this system. For the DPR, Trump\u2019s suggested policies could signal a change in attitude towards the Ukrainian crisis. \n\n\n     Follow us on Facebook!                                                   \n                                                   \n\n       Follow us on Twitter! \n                               \n\n             Donate!"

            "November 14, 2016 - Fort Russ News - \n\nFabrizio Poggi, in  Contropiano , translated from Italian by Tom Winter \n\nIgor Dodon, President-elect of Moldova \nMoldova and Bulgaria: Something new in the East \nRumen Radev, President-elect of Bulgaria \nIn the east - not everywhere, sadly - there is a turn towards Moscow. The newly elected presidents of Moldavia and Bulgaria seem to want to go in that direction. \n\nIn Kishinev, where two weeks ago, no candidate had a majority in round one, the Socialist Party leader, Igor Dodon, has 52.6% of the votes (not including expatriate votes from US and Canada, but these can not overturn the result) against the pro-EU Maia Sandu, leader of the Action and Solidarity Party, with 47.3% and who, in Yankee fashion, is now threatening \"mass demonstrations,\" not recognizing the result. \nMaia Sandu  Dodon congratulated Sandu for the \"honorable result\" and invited her to discussions, without destabilizing the country. It seems (though not official at this time of writing) that the turnout was respectable; this was the first direct election of the president of the republic since 1996; since 2000 in fact, the President was elected by Parliament. There was even shortage of ballots, in particular in various stations abroad: Bologna, Parma, Paris, Moscow, Bucharest; Portugal appears to have lost the entire st of ballots. \n\nOn the eve of the vote Dodon, an experienced office-holder, (Deputy Prime Minister in 2008-2009 and Minister of Economy in 2006-2009) said that if he won, his first visit abroad would would be to Moscow, \"to start working out a strategic partnership agreement\" and to renew exports to Russia, which were limited after the signing of the association and free trade agreement with the EU.  \n\nDodon has always said he was \"confident of victory. People are tired of the seven years of EU coalition, poverty, corruption, lawlessness, and want to live in a state of their own and not in some province of another country.\"  \n\nThe socialist leader has also called for the Russian peacekeepers to remain in Transnistria, until the complete solution of the political events through the federalization of Moldova, which Sandu opposes. According to Tass, all candidates had based their election campaign primarily on foreign issues: pointing on one side to the \"hand of the Kremlin,\" and, on the other to \"Washington's Regional Committee,\"  a side which was still floating a union with Romania. The Socialists pointed to Maia Sandu as \"a puppet of the US\" - where she studied and worked at the World Bank, and tied her to Angela Merkel, Donald Tusk, and Jean-Claude Juncker, apparently even to former Romanian President, Traian B\u0103sescu, who got himself awarded Moldovan citizenship [! -tr] in order to vote for Maia Sandu.  \n\nOn the other side Sandu was proposing, along with strategic partnership with Washington, close contacts with Kiev, even a future union with Romania. \n\nAs expected, there are the threats of yet another \"Orange Revolution,\" like the one in 2009 after the Communist Party won the election in Moldova, under the flags of EU and Romania, with rioting which brought broken windows and arson to the Parliament and the presidential residence.  \n\nObviously, Brussels was on the \"orange\" side: the results of seven years of EU-line coalition are also seen in the demonstrations a year ago against the oligarchy in power, in the rejection of government policy on the part of 80% of the population, and in those favoring integration with Brussels falling from 70% to 37%.  \n\nIn addition, the Donald Trump victory seems to have played a role also in Kishinev: \"The geopolitical color of the Moldovan leadership will become less important for the United States,\" Andrei Popov said in a NewsMaker interview. Popov, former Deputy Foreign Minister of Moldova, added that Washington will renounce a whole series of Moldovan projects that were initiated by the Clinton circle. \n\nAlso, in Bulgaria, the coalition headed by the Socialist Party prevailed in the second presidential round of the general election: Air Force General Rumen Radev topped his opponent Tsetska Tsa\u010deva by 4-5% (the result is not final). Tsa\u010deva was the candidate of the pro-government coalition GERB (\"Citizens for European development of Bulgaria).\"  \n\nIn the first round, Sunday, Nov. 6, no candidate reached the 30% necessary for the election: Radev was at 25.4% and Tsa\u010deva at 21.9%.  \n\nThe now president-elect said he was opposed to Bulgaria's permanence in NATO (of which the country has been a member since 2004) and in the EU, and has spoken out for closer relations with Russia.  \n\nThe Prime Minister, the hawk Boyko Borissov had promised to resign if Radev won, while he was still hoping for a Tsa\u010deva victory, seems to have kept his word, opening a crisis that does not seem easy to solve. \n\nIn opposition to the overtly anti-Russian, phil-atlantic policies of former President Rosen Plevneliev and Boyko Borissov, Radev said that \"deepening the dialogue with Russia will reduce confrontation and tension, and hopefully lead to the normalization of the situation in Syria and Ukraine.\"  \n\nWith regard to the anti-Russian sanctions, he stressed that this \"is a matter of the government's responsibility. But, as President, I am committed to dialogue, to seek a solution with EU colleagues.\" As for internal affairs, he said \"despite threats of the apocalypse,\" the voters \"voted for change and democracy, overcoming apathy and fear.\" \n\nAn entity that in contrast does not change policy towards Russia is the European Union.  Federica Mogherini,  EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs, said that Brussels does not intend to change its own position on Russia, even if the White House, after the arrival of Donald Trump, pursues a rapprochement with the Kremlin.  \n\nThe EU, as Mogherini spelled it out, \"has a principled stand on the issue of the annexation of the Crimea and on the situation in Ukraine, and will not change it, regardless of any changes of position by other countries, including the United States.  \n\n\"Ipse dixit et salvavit eos**; of course, the \"Russian aggression! \n\n\n* A view from the Italian Communist Party on-line journal; for the take of Eduard Popov on these two election victories, click. \n\n** \"She herself has said it, and saved them\" [Correcting to \"ipsa\"] -- an apparent reference to the Catholic confessional \"dixi et salvavi animam\" -- I have spoken and saved my soul.\"\n\n     Follow us on Facebook!                                                   \n                                                   \n\n       Follow us on Twitter! \n                               \n\n             Donate!"

            "BOMBSHELL: Hillary Clinton\u2019s Leaked Audio Proves She Rigs Elections Posted on October 30, 2016 by Dawn Parabellum in Politics Share This \nAstonishing, newly released leaked audio of Democrat presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has just surfaced, and what it reveals is damning. In her own voice, we hear the corrupt Democrat telling reporters that elections can and should be rigged to ensure who wins. This throws the validity of every government on earth in the shredder because she isn\u2019t only talking about rigging American presidential elections. \nSince the FBI reopened their investigation into the criminal Democrat and Hillary seeks a powerful position to dictate the lives of others, it\u2019s important to hear this audio. She is blatant when she say elections shouldn\u2019t take place unless we make \u201csure that we did something to determine who was going to win.\u201d \nHear it from her own mouth: \nHillary clearly said, \u201cI do not think we should have pushed for an election in the Palestinian territories. I think that was a big mistake. And if we were going to push for an election, then we should have made sure that we did something to determine who was going to win. \u201d \nThis conversation took place in 2006 during a discussion with Eli Chomsky, an editor and staff writer for the Jewish Press. At the time, Hillary Clinton was running for a \u201cshoo-in re-election\u201d as a U.S. senator. \nHer trip, making the rounds of editorial boards, brought her to Brooklyn to meet the editorial board of the Jewish Press. Her conversation was secretly recorded, and the audio hasn\u2019t been released until now. \nAccording to Chomsky, this little audio clip has only been heard by the small handful of Jewish Press staffers in the room. He claims his copy is the only copy and no one has heard it since 2006 \u2014 until now. Election rigging Democrat, Hillary Clinton \nIt proves she is willing to do whatever it takes to win. With massive amounts of voter fraud already being reported in favor of the most criminal and corrupt politician of our time, in combination with this audio, it\u2019s hard to deny that Hillary wouldn\u2019t rig the election to win. \nLuckily, Americans are wising up to her disturbing antics. We all saw her cheat during the debates , and the proof came out in leaked emails, thanks to WikiLeaks. \nIt\u2019s important to hear this, coming directly from Hillary herself, and we can all tell that it is her voice. We all know she\u2019s rigging this election to beat Donald Trump, but she obviously has had her hands in rigged elections before. \nIt is hard to say how many elections across the globe she has influenced or just stolen. Hillary Clinton will stop at nothing to grab even a small amount of power, and she continues to prove she is as corrupt as they come."

            "We Are Change \nBy J. Christian Adams\nVia PJ Media\n\nLeaked funding documents reveal an effort by George Soros and his foundations to manipulate election laws and process rules ahead of the federal election far more expansively than has been previously reported.\nThe billionaire and convicted felon moved hundreds of millions of dollars into often-secret efforts to change election laws, fuel litigation to attack election integrity measures, push public narratives about voter fraud, and to integrate the political ground game of the left with efforts to scare racial minority groups about voting rights threats.\nThese Soros-funded efforts moved through dozens of 501(c)(3) and (c)(4) charities and involved the active compliance with civil rights groups, government officials, and purportedly non-partisan groups like the League of Women Voters.\nThe leaked documents also reveal deliberate and successful efforts to manipulate media coverage of election issues in mainstream media outlets like the The New York Times . \nConservatives and Republicans have no opposing effort or source of funds that represents even a small fraction in opposition to level of the Soros-led manipulation contained in the leaked documents.\nThe documents reveal that the Soros campaign fueled litigation attacking election integrity measures, such as citizenship verification and voter ID. It funded long-term efforts to fundamentally transform election administration \u2014 including the creation of databases that were marketed to state governments for use in voter verification. It propped up left-leaning media to attack reports of voter fraud, and conducted racially and ideologically targeted voter registration drives.\nThe racially targeted voter registration drives were executed at the same time Soros dollars were funding other public relations efforts to polarize racial minority groups by scaring them about the loss of voting rights and the dangers of police officers.\nThe Soros documents reveal hundreds of millions of dollars being poured into the effort to transform the legal and media environment touching on elections. One document notes that poverty-alleviation programs are being de-emphasized for this new effort. It states: \u201cGeorge Soros has authorized U.S. Programs to propose a budget of $320 million over two years, with the understanding that the annual budget for U.S. Programs will be $150 million beginning in 2013.\u201d\nThe purpose of the expansion is clear:\nThe increase in Democracy and Power Fund budget will expand funding of non-partisan voter engagement to catalyze participation from African-American, Latino, immigrant, and youth communities in particular, and to ensure a fair and just redistricting process. The increase in the Transparency and Integrity Fund will expand support for election reform, judicial independence and journalism.\nBelow are some highlights of this expansive Soros-funded campaign to alter the legal environment and rules of American elections.\nRead more: https://pjmedia.com/jchristianadams/2016/11/07/leaked-documents-reveal-expansive-soros-funding-to-manipulate-federal-elections/\n\nThe post Leaked Documents Reveal Expansive Soros Funding to Manipulate Federal Elections appeared first on We Are Change ."

            "Email \nBillionaire globalist George Soros (shown) has been dumping hundreds of millions of dollars into manipulating American elections in recent years, leaked documents show . While many critics have focused on his indirect links to a controversial voting-machine company , his electoral scheming goes much deeper, as a review of the documents by PJ Media shows . Rather than tampering with the outcome of particular elections, leaks from Soros' Open Society apparatus show he has far greater ambitions. Basically, he is seeking to \u201cfundamentally transform America,\u201d as Obama put it, by changing and manipulating the American electorate into supporting globalism, statism, collectivism, and his legions of radical politicians and elected officials. Soros, a self-described atheist, has also been exposed seeking to corrupt Christianity with his radical anti-Christian views . But as awareness of the scheming spreads, the Soros brand is becoming increasingly toxic among Americans from all walks of life. \nSoros' assault on American elections revealed in leaked foundation documents is broad and multi-faceted. Among other schemes, the proteg\u00e9 of the unfathomably wealthy Rothschild banking dynasty has launched legal assaults on state-level efforts to limit voter fraud and ensure the integrity of elections. Essentially, the ploy appears to be aimed at facilitating mass voter fraud. Soros foundations have also been funding propaganda campaigns, racist ethnocentric \u201cmedia\u201d outlets, the subversion of journalism, vicious attacks on patriotic organizations, and more. The Soros network has also provided huge infusions of money to fringe and sometimes violent left-wing extremists and race-mongers (including racist groups like La Raza, or The Race) to build up pro-Soros AstroTurf groups. In direct politics, Soros has also been showering money on radical candidates at the local, state, and federal levels who will advance his anti-American, anti-Christian, anti-Constitution agenda. \nSome of the Soros funding is aimed at what is described in leaked documents as a plot to \u201cbuild power\u201d for \u201csystemic change.\u201d Indeed, the Soros machine even created the \u201cDemocracy and Power Fund\u201d in a bid to dupe various groups of Americans into serving as a collectivist coalition to push Soros' extreme big government agenda. These groups, centered around attributes such as race and income, include \u201cpeople of color, immigrants, young people, and low income people,\u201d the document shows. Blacks and Latinos are both in Soros' crosshairs. The fund, according to leaked documents, seeks to \u201cinspire\u201d these groups with \u201cmulti-issue advocacy\u201d to push Soros' agenda at the federal, state, and local levels. Between 2010 and 2012, Soros dropped $15 million on his \u201cPower Fund.\u201d As the name of the fund suggests, securing power for himself and the establishment at the expense of the Constitution and the American people is exactly what Soros, a convicted felon, has in mind. \nTo ensure that the propaganda and hate that Soros minions produce receive the requisite media coverage, Soros has also been building up his own personal \u201cmedia\u201d megaphone. Among other schemes, Soros was exposed funding something called \u201cNew America Media,\u201d which pumps out ethnocentric collectivism and race-mongering to thousands of propaganda organs under the guise of \u201cethnic\u201d media. Also funded by the Soros machine is what documents refer to as a \u201cMedia Consortium.\u201d As if the establishment media was not \u201cprogressive\u201d enough, Soros documents explain that the funding helps \u201ca network of leading progressive independent journalism organizations focused on making connections, building a media infrastructure, and amplifying the voices of progressive journalists in the United States.\u201d Apparently the Soros-funded \u201cconsortium\u201d has \u201cdone much to build community and greater strength among progressive media outlets.\u201d \nJ. Christian Adams, the former Justice Department attorney who left in 2010 after accusing the outfit of racial bias, explained the significance of Soros' media scheming in his in-depth investigation of the leaked Soros documents published by PJ Media . \u201cMainstream journalists frequently parrot progressive writers when covering voter fraud, thus rendering the Media Consortium Soros dollars well spent,\u201d Adams wrote in an article that was posted on the Drudge Report before going viral. \u201cThe leaked documents also reveal deliberate and successful efforts to manipulate media coverage of election issues in mainstream media outlets like the The New York Times .\u201d \nWhen it comes to Soros manipulating press coverage of voter fraud, the process works similar to the Soros machine's Black Lives Matter operation. \u201cThe leaked funding documents describe how the propaganda about the 'myth of voter fraud' is generated by two Soros-funded organizations, moved to blogger and racially-centric media outlets, and eventually to mainstream media,\u201d Adams explained. Indeed, almost the exact same process is used by Soros to promote hatred of the police and racial agitation, with the ultimate goal of nationalizing law enforcement. As The New American has previously reported , Soros-funded groups protest and riot, Soros-funded academics produce propaganda \u201cstudies\u201d to justify the narrative, and then Soros-funded propaganda organs provide media coverage of it all. The Washington Times described the Soros propaganda machine as an \u201cecho chamber.\u201d \nThe Soros network funds an incredible array of organizations that advance his extremism. Among those that are involved in fundamentally transforming America by manipulating the electoral system, many receive more than half of a million dollars annually. Among them is the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, which brings together left-wing extremists, anti-constitutional radicals, overtly racist groups such as \u201cLa Raza\u201d (The Race), statist-controlled Big Labor groups, known communist front groups officially condemned by U.S. authorities as \u201csubversive,\u201d and more. This year, the radical alliance even called on a UN-linked international organization founded and largely controlled by communist and socialist regimes to oversee U.S. elections . Other groups on the Soros dole are the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, the extremist Center for American Progress , Advancement Project, Center for Community Change, Brennan Center, and more. The supposedly non-partisan League of Women Voters is also deeply involved with the Soros machine. \nSoros also partners with various establishment controlled tax-exempt mega-foundations such as Atlantic Philanthropies, Carnegie, Ford, and New World Foundations, among others. It partnered with the globalist Rockefeller Brothers Fund in a scheme to change voter registration policies. Much insight about the Rockefellers' totalitarian agenda was revealed by dynasty boss David Rockefeller, who showered praise on the mass-murdering regime of Chairman Mao for leading what he touted as \u201cone of the most important and successful\u201d social experiments \u201cin history.\u201d Some 60 million to 100 million people were killed as part of the experiment Rockefeller was so pleased with. In his autobiography, Rockefeller also boasted about conspiring with a secret cabal against his country to build a global political system. \u201cSome even believe [the Rockefellers] are part of a secret cabal working against the best interests of the United States, characterizing my family and me as \u2018internationalists\u2019 conspiring with others around the world to build a more integrated global political and economic structure \u2014 one world, if you will,\u201d Rockefeller wrote in his book. \u201cIf that\u2019s the charge, I stand guilty, and I\u2019m proud of it.\u201d Soros shares the same agenda . \nWikiLeaks has also revealed some interesting facts about Soros' political machinations. Indeed, Soros is mentioned more than 50 times in the Clinton and Democrat e-mails released so far. One e-mail is from Jacqueline Carozza, a Soros employee, to Clinton campaign boss and anti-Catholic bigot John Podesta. \u201cWith summer quickly approaching Mr. and Mrs. Soros are starting to plan the 2015 Southampton schedule and would enjoy your company,\u201d she wrote last year to Podesta , who was also invited to an occult \u201cSpirit Cooking\u201d event with satanic overtones. \u201cPlease let me know which dates suit you best to come for a visit and hopefully we can coordinate a mutually convenient time for your stay.\u201d \nBeyond manipulating Americans into surrendering their heritage and their liberty, leaked documents also show that Soros has also been at the forefront of the establishment's efforts to corrupt Christianity. As The New American reported in August, hacked e-mails from his vast empire of shady tax-exempt foundations show that the radical \u201cphilanthropist\u201d wants to change the views of Christians and churches around the world using deceit, manipulation, and lots and lots of money. His goals in showering money on Christian groups and churches include, among other policy agendas, legalizing the slaughter of unborn children in pro-life nations, promoting what he calls \u201cracial and economic justice,\u201d ensnaring more nations in the European Union, pushing global governance and what he calls the \u201cNew World Order\u201d (which he said should be \u201cowned\u201d by Communist China) , and even shifting \u201cthe priorities of the U.S. Catholic church.\u201d One document on funding \u201cChristian\u201d schemes speaks of pursuing \u201cstructural transformation of political and economic systems.\u201d And that is just what is known. \nIn addition to trying to subvert churches into supporting his anti-Christian agenda, Soros has also been leading the effort to flood what was once known as \u201cChristendom\u201d with Islamic migrants from the globalist wars he helped engineer and justify . Indeed, Soros and his Open Society operations around the world have been key players in every phase of the ongoing mass-migration of millions of Middle Eastern and African migrants into Europe and the United States. Borders, Soros wrote in a column, are an \u201cobstacle.\u201d Leaked documents revealed that the Soros machine wields enormous influence in the European Union, the Obama administration, and the United Nations as it relates to the so-called \u201crefugee crisis.\u201d The goal, of course, is to fundamentally transform the entire Western world and to subvert nation-states on the road to internationalism. \nAs Adams notes in his PJ Media piece, conservatives and Republicans \u201chave no opposing effort or source of funds that represents even a small fraction in opposition to level of the Soros-led manipulation contained in the leaked documents.\u201d If America, the West, liberty, and self-government are to survive, Soros' machinations and those of the broader establishment he represents must be exposed and effectively countered. The alternative is what Soros has in the past referred to as a \u201cNew World Order.\u201d And that will not be pretty, as a fundamentally transformed United States is subjugated by globalist radicals like Soros and his dangerous totalitarian allies.

            "The WRH server is back to normal (except for the hack attacks). THOUGHT FOR THE DAY! \"When buying shares, ask yourself, would you buy the whole company?\" -- Rene Rivkin YOUR RANDOM DHS MONITORED PHRASE OF THE DAY DERA \nPaid advertising at What Really Happened may not represent the views and opinions of this website and its contributors. No endorsement of products and services advertised is either expressed or implied. \nHOW TO HAVE HONEST ELECTIONS \"It is enough that the people know there was an election. The people who cast the votes decide nothing. The people who count the votes decide everything.\" -- Joseph Stalin \nFollowing the Florida election debacle of 2000, Americans were promised a more honest, transparent, and verifiable system of elections. We didn;t get it, because the elkection stealers won that election and decided that keeping the current system was their best guaarantee of re-election. \nThe election of 2016 changed that. The candidate being cheated by the system, Donald Trump, still prevailed thanks to a landslide that overcame the vote rigging. He will see having an honest election system as his best chance for a second term. Hence, there is a real opportunity to throw out the current system, whch is designed to encourage stealing elections, and replace it with a system that hinders cheating as much as possible. \nTo begin, stolen elections are a reality in this nation. John F. Kennedy stole the 1960 election from Richard Nixon. Nixon stole his re-election in what becvame known as the Watergate scandal. George W. Bush likely stole the 2000 election from Al Gore, and everyone had a ring-side seat watching Hillary Clinton trying to steal the election from Donald Trump. \nA good place to start to learn about election stealing is the HBO documentary, \"Hacking Democracy.\" It is available on NetFlix, Amazon Live, and Hulu. Here is a YouTube video of the final scenes showing how an electronic voting machine has the election results changed without even needing to touch the machine! \nFor more information, please visit http://blackboxvoting.org/ , the website operated by Bev Harris, who is featured in the HBO documentary. \nNow then, I wish to offer a suggestion for a very simple way to have an open and honest election system. It is not 100% foolproof, but is designed to make it very difficult for cheating to happen and difficult to conceal it. This stands in sharp contrast to the current system, which is designed to facilitate and conceal the manipulation of elections. \nFirst, some basic rules. \n1. No electronic machines! \n2. No central tabulation centers! \nEveryone who votes must have ID to prove they are a US citizen and eligable to vote. Absentee ballots are only given to those who can prove they are unable to vote in person. \nAfter the voters vote, their finger is marked with ink that takes a week to fade away, to prevent them from voting more than once. \nAll voting is done on paper ballots. When the polls close, the precincts hand-count the ballots in full view of witnesses, and verify the accuracy. All paper ballots are to be stored for an entire year after the election. \nThe totals for that polling place are posted for all to see and copies provided to all witnesses. \nIn the city newspaper the next day, all the totals for all the city precincts are printed, along with totals for the state. This allows everyone to first verify that their precinct totals were reported accurately, and to verify the math leading to the city totals for themselves. \nNow, we move up a level! The state newspapers print all the city totals, and again the totals for the state. This allows everyone to first verify that their city totals were reported accurately, and to verify the math leading to the state totals for themselves. \nFinal level: The national newspapers print all the state totals, and tally up the winners. This allows everyone to first verify that their state totals were reported accurately, and to verify the math leading to the national totals for themselves. \nWhat this does is create a system where there are literally millions of Americans watching and verifying the vote counts from polling place to final totals. Yes, it is a bit slower than the instant-guessing on TV, but that will prevent the corporate media from using \"projections\" to try to discourage voters of unfavored candidates from heading to the polls. There is in fact no law that says the winners of the elections have to be announced immediately, and certainly most Americans are willing to trade speed for accuracy in such an important matter. In the early days of this nation, prior to the telegraph, it would take weeks for the populace to learn who won the elections! \nAs I said, this is not a 100% perfect system. It is only as good as the people running it. But it does make stealing elections very difficult and that should always be the design objective of any election system!

            "Email \nPoll-watching junkies are having a field day. There is one poll or another publishing its results on an almost hourly basis. As this is being written on noon Sunday, for instance, Investors Business Daily (IBD), which touts its survey as \u201cthe most accurate poll in recent presidential elections,\" has Donald Trump ahead of Hillary Clinton by one point. The USC Dornsife/ Los Angeles Times \u2019 \u201cDaybreak\u201d poll shows Trump ahead of Clinton by five points. \nNate Silver, in his FiveThirtyEight 2016 Election Forecast, has Clinton\u2019s chance of winning at 64.7 percent versus Trump\u2019s 35.3 percent. Silver predicts Clinton will win 48.4 percent of the popular vote (versus Trump\u2019s 45.5 percent, which will give her 291 Electoral College votes to Trump\u2019s 246. \nIn its running summary of other polls, Real Clear Politics shows Clinton up by 1.8 percent over Trump in the popular vote, while in the Electoral College it\u2019s Clinton with 216 and Trump with 164, leaving 158 votes as \u201ctoss ups.\" \nThere are at least two other prognosticators who don\u2019t rely on polls at all, and they are predicting Trump will win on Tuesday. The first was explained by Tyler Durden at ZeroHedge back in January when he said that the stock market would predict November\u2019s winner: This relationship occurs because the stock market reflects the economic outlook in the weeks leading up to the election. A rising stock market indicates an improving economy, which means rising confidence and increases the chances of the incumbent party\u2019s re-election. Therefore, your time might be better spent from August through October watching the stock market rather than the debates if you want to know who will be President for the next four years. \nRight on cue the stock market has declined nine days in a row (through last Friday), the first time that has happened since 1980. But more importantly is how it has behaved since Monday, August 1. The S&P 500 Index has declined by 4.5 percent which, according to Durden, translates into an 86 percent chance of Trump\u2019s winning on Tuesday. \nAnd then there\u2019s the professor from Stony Brook University, Helmut Norpoth, and his \u201cPrimary Model\u201d. Writes Norpoth on his website: Winning early primaries is a major key for electoral victory in November. Trump won the Republican primaries in both New Hampshire and South Carolina, while Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders split the Democratic primaries in those states\u2026. For the record the Primary Model \u2026 has correctly predicted the winner of the popular vote in all five presidential elections since it was introduced in 1996\u2026. For elections from 1912 to 2012 the Primary Model [has retroactively picked] the winner \u2026 every time except in 1960. \nAccordingly, Norpoth gives Trump an 87 percent chance of winning Tuesday\u2019s election. \nThere\u2019s also his \u201cpendulum\u201d model: What favors the GOP in 2016 as well \u2026 is the cycle of presidential elections. After two terms of Democrat Barack Obama in the White House the electoral pendulum is poised to swing to the GOP this year\u2026. Donald Trump is predicted to defeat Hillary Clinton by 52.5 percent to 47.5 percent. \nIn the \u201cfor what it\u2019s worth\u201d category, as this is being written, futures for Monday\u2019s open are also turning negative. If the market closes down again on Monday, the 10th day in a row, it will only add validity to both Durden\u2019s and Norpoth\u2019s prediction: Trump will win on Tuesday. \nAlso, Professor Norpoth has such confidence in his models that he is using his own money to bet on Trump to win. \n\nAn Ivy League graduate and former investment advisor, Bob is a regular contributor to The New American magazine and blogs frequently at LightFromTheRight.com, primarily on economics and politics.

            "Obama Admits to Rigged Elections back in 2008 10/27/2016 \nTRUTH REVOLT \nThere\u2019s a lot of accusations going around that the 2016 election is rigged. From Democrats suggesting Russia is tampering with the presidential election to a plethora of documents and undercover video that proves Democrats are trying their darnedest to sway the outcome. \nPresident Obama has laughed off the notion that Bernie Sanders was forced out by the DNC and believes Donald Trump is out of his mind for suggesting elections are rigged. And of course, Obama would never admit that Hillary Clinton could do something wrong. But candidate Obama, in 2008, sure was concerned that the election might be rigged against him. \nVideo of him answering a campaign question has surfaced to put to rest the notion that he doesn\u2019t believe in the possibility: \n\u201cWell, I tell you what: it helps in Ohio that we\u2019ve got Democrats in charge of the machines. [Cheering] But look, I come from Chicago, so I want to be honest, it\u2019s not as if it\u2019s just Republicans who have monkeyed around with elections in the past, sometimes Democrats have too. You know, whenever people are in power, they\u2019re \u2014 you know, they have this tendency to try to, you know, tilt things in their direction.\u201d \nWatch above. \nThe Freedom Center is a 501c3 non-profit organization. Therefore we do not endorse political candidates either in primary or general elections. However, as defenders of America\u2019s social contract, we insist that the rules laid down by both parties at the outset of campaigns be respected, and that the results be decided by free elections. We will oppose any attempt to rig the system and deny voters of either party their constitutional right to elect candidates of their choice."
