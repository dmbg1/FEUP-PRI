        "body_en": "By Sarah Jones on Sun, Oct 30th, 2016 at 8:59 pm Senator Harry Reid dropped the bomb that the FBI and national security experts possess \"explosive information\" about ties and coordination between Russia and Donald Trump and his campaign. Share on Twitter Print This Post \nTalk about burying the lede. \nIn Senator Harry Reid\u2019s letter in which he suggests that FBI Director James Comey may have broken the law (the Hatch Law), he also drops the bomb that the FBI and national security experts possess \u201cexplosive information\u201d about ties and coordination between Russia and Donald Trump and his campaign. \nReid writes, \u201cIn my communications with you and other top officials in the national security community, it has become clear that you possess explosive information about close ties and coordination between Donald Trump, his top advisors, and the Russian government \u2013 a foreign interest openly hostile to the United States, which Trump praises at every opportunity.\u201d \nReid points out the \u201cdisturbing double standard\u201d in Comey\u2019s treatment of sensitive information between the two parties with a \u201cclear intent\u201d to aid one over the other. \nIf the FBI and national security experts have information that Donald Trump and or his campaign are colluding or collaborating to bring about a particular result regarding the U.S. election or our foreign policy stances, this is an emergency. \nWhich issue is so much of an emergency that a federal official might consider dropping the bomb just 11 days before an election: Electing someone who is conspiring with Russia or electing someone whose aide may have sent an email she forget to tell everyone about. \nThe double standard is not only troubling at this point, but dangerous. \nBomb dropped. \nEveryone already suspected Trump\u2019s ties to Russia and his campaign has been full of ties to the Kremlin, but now Reid has confirmed information about coordination between Trump and Russia. \nNow that, ladies and gentlemen, is an October shocker. \nReid\u2019s full letter follows: \nDear Director Comey: \nYour actions in recent months have demonstrated a disturbing double standard for the treatment of sensitive information, with what appears to be a clear intent to aid one political party over another. I am writing to inform you that my office has determined that these actions may violate the Hatch Act, which bars FBI officials from using their official authority to influence an election. Through your partisan actions, you may have broken the law. \nThe double standard established by your actions is clear. \nIn my communications with you and other top officials in the national security community, it has become clear that you possess explosive information about close ties and coordination between Donald Trump, his top advisors, and the Russian government \u2013 a foreign interest openly hostile to the United States, which Trump praises at every opportunity. The public has a right to know this information. I wrote to you months ago calling for this information to be released to the public. There is no danger to American interests from releasing it. And yet, you continue to resist calls to inform the public of this critical information. \nBy contrast, as soon as you came into possession of the slightest innuendo related to Secretary Clinton, you rushed to publicize it in the most negative light possible. \nMoreover, in tarring Secretary Clinton with thin innuendo, you overruled longstanding tradition and the explicit guidance of your own Department. You rushed to take this step eleven days before a presidential election, despite the fact that for all you know, the information you possess could be entirely duplicative of the information you already examined which exonerated Secretary Clinton. \nAs you know, a memo authored by Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates on March 10, 2016, makes clear that all Justice Department employees, including you, are subject to the Hatch Act. The memo defines the political activity prohibited under the Hatch Act as \u201cactivity directed towards the success or failure of a political party, candidate for partisan political office, or partisan political group.\u201d \nThe clear double-standard established by your actions strongly suggests that your highly selective approach to publicizing information, along with your timing, was intended for the success or failure of a partisan candidate or political group. \nPlease keep in mind that I have been a supporter of yours in the past. When Republicans filibustered your nomination and delayed your confirmation longer than any previous nominee to your position, I led the fight to get you confirmed because I believed you to be a principled public servant. \nWith the deepest regret, I now see that I was wrong. \nSincerely, \nSenator Harry Reid",

        "body_en": "FBI officials say their investigation into links between US Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and Russia has been unable to uncover any so far, according to the New York Times.\nThe bureau has been trying to find evidence showing that the Russian government is trying to influence the US presidential campaign since the beginning of summer. FBI agents have put advisers close to GOP candidate Donald Trump under close scrutiny, searching for financial connections that some have alleged exist between the nominee and Russian financial figures. They even followed up on a lead hinting that there had been a secret email correspondence between Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Organization and Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Alfa-bank. All the while, the bureau has been searching for the hackers that breached the computers of the Democratic camp and leaked emails that became the source of many scandals damaging to Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s campaign.\nNonetheless, the FBI still cannot say that any of its investigations have uncovered direct links between Trump and Russian authorities, the New York Times reported on Monday, citing recent interviews and its own bureau sources.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153No evidence has emerged that would link [Trump] or anyone else in his business or political circle directly to Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election operations,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d writes the NYT.\nOfficials also anonymously told the NYT that whoever the hackers were, the attacks were aimed at disrupting the presidential race on the whole, and not boosting Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chances of getting into the Oval Office, as the Western media and Democrats have been claiming.\nIn explaining why Russia would want to interfere in the campaign, one senior official was cited as saying, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t about the election\u00e2\u20ac\u015a It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s about a threat to democracy.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\nThe FBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inquiries will continue, however. In interviews over the past several weeks, intelligence officials have signaled that they have opened a larger probe to look into suspicions over connections between Trump aides and Moscow.\nIn the most recent lead, an anonymous computer scientist going by the name Tea Leaves found some 2,700 \u00e2\u20ac\u0153look-up\u00e2\u20ac\u009d messages that tied a server being used by one of Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s companies to those of Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Alfa Bank.\nStill, the FBI found that there was no two-way communication, and these messages could have been marketing emails or spam. Both the Trump campaign and Alfa Bank issued statements denying that they had been in communication.\n\nThe FBI is also probing Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, whose foreign business and political dealings have come under scrutiny since reports surfaced claiming he was involved with a pro-Russian political party in Ukraine, NBC reported, citing intelligence sources.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcRussia hacking\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 vs Clinton emails \nA separate report from CNBC citing a former FBI official claims that the bureau\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s director, James Comey, was privately reluctant about naming Russia as the entity responsible for meddling in the US election campaign, reportedly saying it was too close to the November 8 Election Day.\nIn the beginning of October, Comey allegedly concluded that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a foreign power was trying to undermine the election,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d but arguing against putting it out before the election itself.\nHe also allegedly made sure that the Federal Bureau of Investigation was not mentioned in the document compiled by the US government on October 7, which officially accused Russia of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153authorizing\u00e2\u20ac\u009d the hacking of emails accounts of US officials and organizations, out of concern that the FBI would be seen as interfering with the election if it was included.\nHowever, last Friday, with the election mere days away, Comey announced that the bureau was reopening its investigation into Hillary Clinton because several hundred thousand new emails that may be related to the private server used by the Democratic nominee had allegedly been discovered.\nThe announcement, which left many in the government puzzled, has already resulted in official complaints and attacks from the entire US political spectrum. On Monday, some 100 former federal prosecutors and senior Department of Justice officials, including Attorney General Eric Holder, signed a letter expressing concern over Comey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to reopen the case \u00e2\u20ac\u0153on the eve of a major election,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the mere disclosure of information may impact the election\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s outcome\u00e2\u20ac\u009d at this stage.\nClinton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s supporters have accused Comey of deliberately hiding \u00e2\u20ac\u0153explosive\u00e2\u20ac\u009d information about Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s alleged ties to Russia, demanding that he discuss them publicly, just as he did with the new batch of Clinton-related emails.\nHillary Clinton and her supporters have repeatedly criticized Trump for praising Russian President Vladimir Putin, while Trump has retorted that he has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153nothing to do\u00e2\u20ac\u009d with Russia and doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know its leader personally.\nPutin on accusations of meddling: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcrubbish\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 \nRussia, in turn, has denied having any links to the Trump camp on numerous occasions, while refuting accusations that it had been behind the hacking attacks on the Democrats, with Russian President Vladimir Putin calling them \u00e2\u20ac\u0153rubbish\u00e2\u20ac\u009d last week.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The image [that Russia supports a candidate in the US presidential election] was created by the media,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Putin said at the Valdai Discussion Club in Sochi last Thursday, stressing that this had been done deliberately.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is complete and utter rubbish, and it is just a method of internal political struggle, as well as a way of manipulating the public consciousness ahead of the US presidential elections,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d he added, while explaining that Russia does not prefer any particular candidate and is ready to work with either of them. Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president also stressed that friendly words and intentions to normalize relations between the US and Russia are always welcome, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153whoever expresses them.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\nSource",

        "body_en": "Hillary Reboots \u2018Vast Right-Wing Conspiracy\u2019 Playbook 10/31/2016 \nLIFEZETTE \nBefore even 24 hours had passed since the FBI director informed Congress on Friday that it was reopening the probe into Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails, Clinton suggested the director was in cahoots with the Republican Party. \n\u201cWe\u2019ve made it very clear that, if they are going to be sending this kind of letter that is only going originally to Republican members of the House, that they need to share whatever facts they claim to have with the American people,\u201d Clinton said on Friday, after initially being blindsided by the FBI\u2019s announcement. \nThe claim wasn\u2019t true. All you had to do is turn the page and find Democratic members of Congress who had also received the letter from the FBI. But it shows how ready Clinton is to fight anyone in the government who dares investigate or question her. It is likely a habit Clinton picked up when she was first lady, from 1993 to 2001. \nClinton\u2019s opening salvo, though weak, is a sign of more to come. Her coming attack on the FBI and its director, James Comey, will likely begin in earnest on Monday, with her operatives using the letter to Congress as proof Clinton is the victim of a political conspiracy. \nClinton previewed her attack in Daytona Beach, Florida, on Saturday, when she said the letter was \u201cunprecedented and deeply troubling.\u201d \nClinton will also turn the issue into one of \u201ctransparency\u201d \u2014 even though FBI investigations are inherently not transparent. In Daytona, she called on Comey to \u201cexplain everything right away, put it all right on the table\u201d \u2014 a demand she knows will go unheeded. \nBut many of Clinton\u2019s allies in the media are likely to demand to see the emails found on former Rep. Anthony Weiner\u2019s laptop. \nIt\u2019s a strategy that could work, even with only a few days left until Election Day. \nSuch attacks on law enforcement worked fairly well for Clinton in 1998, when she and her husband, then-President Bill Clinton, vilified independent counsel Kenneth Starr. Starr had been tasked by Bill Clinton\u2019s own attorney general to investigate corruption charges, but likely rued the day he ever took the job. \nIn 1994, Bill Clinton faced questions from many, including The New York Times, about an investment the Clintons made in a company called Whitewater Development Corp. Bill Clinton\u2019s attorney general, Janet Reno, made Robert Fiske the independent counsel. \nFiske would later be replaced by Starr. Starr\u2019s investigation would later reach into charges that President Clinton had lied in the Paula Jones sexual harassment civil trial. With explosive charges being published by the Drudge Report and Newsweek in January 1998 that Bill Clinton had seduced an intern, Monica Lewinsky, the Clintons could have been expected to admit the truth and take the punishments. \nInstead, the Clinton White House and the Democrats began attacking Starr and the Republicans. \nOn Jan. 27, 1998, Hillary Clinton went on NBC\u2019s \u201cThe Today Show\u201d and goaded the press into covering the opposition rather than President Bill Clinton, who had lied about his affair with Lewinsky just one day earlier. \nMatt Lauer asked if Hillary Clinton had said the fight against Starr would be the \u201clast great battle\u201d of the Clinton White House. \n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve been that dramatic,\u201d Hillary Clinton replied. \u201cBut I do believe that this is a battle. I mean, look at the very people who are involved in this \u2014 they have popped up in other settings. This is \u2014 the great story here for anybody willing to find it and write about it and explain it is this vast right-wing conspiracy that has been conspiring against my husband since the day he announced for president.\u201d \nThe Starr report on the Clinton scandals was released months later. But what the Clintons are really proud of that is that the Democrats actually gained seats in the 1998 midterm elections, helping to cause a backfire against the GOP. \nThe GOP didn\u2019t have anywhere near the two-thirds majority in the Senate to remove Bill Clinton. In early 1999, the U.S. Senate acquitted Bill Clinton on two charges: obstruction of justice, and perjury. \nIt taught the Clintons the wrong lesson: to fight authorities if authorities questioned them \u2014 even authorities within the Democratic Party. Clinton will be targeting and attacking President Obama\u2019s own FBI director as Obama leaves office.",

        "body_en": "Email \nThe alleged connection between Donald Trump and Russia \u2014 asserted by Hillary Clinton in both the second and third presidential debates as a dodge for the leaked e-mails and other documents which have hounded her candidacy \u2014 has dominated much of the speculative attention of both the mainstream media and social media for weeks. Is there anything to it? Is Trump, in essence, Putin\u2019s puppet, as Clinton claimed in the third debate? \nIn an interesting twist of logic (if one can use that word to describe the incoherent and dissonant arguments made by a woman who still denies \u2014 despite mountains of evidence to the contrary \u2014 that she sent and received classified data over her unsecured, private e-mail server), Hillary Clinton at once claims that Russia is responsible for the hack of the servers of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) in late spring and that there is no way her server was hacked by anyone. Leveraging the anti-Russian sentiment to its fullest, she and others in the DNC have sought to shift the focus away from what was on the servers and toward blaming Russia for the hack. After all, if Russia is trying to throw the election to Trump, wouldn\u2019t the patriotic vote be for Clinton? \nBy the time WikiLeaks announced that a trove of damning documents and e-mails would be published on the Internet, Clinton and the DNC (along with their lapdog media) were already in full-blown \"it was Russia\" mode. On the same day that a video of Donald Trump emerged in which he can be heard bragging of his sexual abuse of women \u2014 which he has since claimed was just \u201clocker room talk\u201d \u2014 WikiLeaks began a rolling release of the promised leaked documents. Both of these stories deserved media attention . Only one got it. \nBy the time the media was ready to report anything on the WikiLeaks dump, it was to speculate as to what part Russia played in the initial hack. Clinton \u2014 in her role as the staunch anti-Russian \u2014 used the timing of the second debate to attack Trump for the video and his supposed ties to Russia, which she plainly blamed for the leaked documents, saying to moderator Martha Raddatz: But, you know, let\u2019s talk about what\u2019s really going on here, Martha, because our intelligence community just came out and said in the last few days that the Kremlin, meaning Putin and the Russian government, are directing the attacks, the hacking on American accounts to influence our election. And WikiLeaks is part of that, as are other sites where the Russians hack information, we don\u2019t even know if it\u2019s accurate information, and then they put it out. We have never in the history of our country been in a situation where an adversary, a foreign power, is working so hard to influence the outcome of the election. And believe me, they\u2019re not doing it to get me elected. They\u2019re doing it to try to influence the election for Donald Trump. \nClinton went even further in the third debate , bringing up Putin in an attempt to dodge a question about a leaked document showing that she gave a speech to a foreign bank in which she said, \u201cMy dream is a hemispheric common market with open trade and open borders.\u201d She \u2014 again \u2014 put the emphasis on the fact that WikiLeaks was providing the leaked documents rather than on what the leaked documents have to say. Then she claimed, on the authority of \u201c17 of our intelligence agencies,\u201d that Russia was behind the hacked and leaked documents: But you are very clearly quoting from WikiLeaks. And what\u2019s really important about WikiLeaks is that the Russian government has engaged in espionage against Americans. They have hacked American websites, American accounts of private people, of institutions. Then they have given that information to WikiLeaks for the purpose of putting it on the Internet. This has come from the highest levels of the Russian government, clearly, from Putin himself, in an effort, as 17 of our intelligence agencies have confirmed, to influence our election. \nTrump rebutted by bringing the conversation back on topic (not his usual strongest point), saying: She wants open borders. People are going to pour into our country. People are going to come in from Syria. She wants 550 percent more people than Barack Obama, and he has thousands and thousands of people. They have no idea where they come from. And you see, we are going to stop radical Islamic terrorism in this country. She won\u2019t even mention the words, and neither will President Obama. So I just want to tell you, she wants open borders. Now we can talk about Putin. I don\u2019t know Putin. He said nice things about me. If we got along well, that would be good. If Russia and the United States got along well and went after ISIS, that would be good. He has no respect for her. He has no respect for our president. And I\u2019ll tell you what: We\u2019re in very serious trouble, because we have a country with tremendous numbers of nuclear warheads \u2014 1,800, by the way \u2014 where they expanded and we didn\u2019t, 1,800 nuclear warheads. And she\u2019s playing chicken. Look, Putin... \nAt this point, Clinton interrupted to say, \u201cWell, that\u2019s because he\u2019d rather have a puppet as president of the United States.\u201d \nSo, getting past the he-said-she-said, what are the facts as we know them? \nOn Monday, the New York Times reported that after conducting a months-long \u201cinvestigation into a Russian role in the American presidential campaign\u201d in which \u201cagents scrutinized advisers close to Donald J. Trump, looked for financial connections with Russian financial figures, searched for those involved in hacking the computers of Democrats, and even chased a lead \u2014 which they ultimately came to doubt \u2014 about a possible secret channel of email communication from the Trump Organization to a Russian bank,\u201d the FBI \u201csees no clear link\u201d between Trump and Russia. Of course, in typical leftist fashion, the Times not-so-gently insinuates that the FBI is guilty of pulling punches in the investigation. Interestingly, the Times seemed to miss that that is exactly what happened in the FBI's investigation into Clinton's e-mail server. \nAs for Clinton\u2019s claims that the purpose of the hacked and leaked documents and e-mails was to influence the election for Trump, the Times article admits: Law enforcement officials say that none of the investigations so far have found any conclusive or direct link between Mr. Trump and the Russian government. And even the hacking into Democratic emails, F.B.I. and intelligence officials now believe, was aimed at disrupting the presidential election rather than electing Mr. Trump. \nAlso on Monday, Slate published an article claiming that a server belonging to Donald Trump was \u201ccommunicating in a secretive fashion\u201d with servers in Russia. By the next day, the Washington Post had debunked the Slate article, saying, \u201cThat secret Trump-Russia email server link is likely neither secret nor a Trump-Russia link.\u201d Based in part on an interview with Naadir Jeewa, who \u201cdoes consulting work on precisely the sorts of systems involved in\u201d the scenario involving the server Slate claims was acting as a conduit between Trump and Russia, the article by the Post explains: To understand what's likely happening, we need to establish a few basics. First of all, the Trump server wasn't really a Trump server. It was much less of a Trump email server, for example, than Hillary Clinton's email server was hers. Clinton had a physical server that hosted her email. The trump-email.com domain that Alfa was connecting to was hosted by a company called Cendyn. Cendyn runs marketing systems for the hospitality industry, meaning that it offers an out-of-the-box solution for a company that owns a bunch of hotels to push out sales pitch emails to its customers. In other words, trump-email.com isn't the email server Trump used to send emails from his closet. It was a domain name that linked back to a Cendyn server. This is important for a few reasons. The first, Jeewa said, was that the trump-email.com was configured to reject a certain type of query from another server. Since its job was simply to push out thousands of enticements to come stay at Trump Soho (or whatever) it didn't need to receive many incoming requests (like incoming email). The second is that the conspiracy theory hinges on Trump's team using an offsite server hosted by someone else for its quiet communications with its Russian allies. Instead of, say, their own server, under their own control. Or an encrypted chat app. Or a phone call. \nThis writer has to admit to being amused to see the shoe on the other foot (or the tinfoil hat on the other head, in this instance) as the Left trots out wild conspiracy theories to create a Trump-Putin connection to make Clinton retroactively correct. In point of fact, Clinton might be better off trying to implicate Trump in the Kennedy assassination. \nBut, what about Clinton\u2019s assertion that WikiLeaks is releasing documents pilfered by Russia for the sake of influencing the election for Trump? Aside from the FBI saying that there does not appear to be any attempt to influence the election for Trump, Julian Assange, the founder and public face of WikiLeaks, denies that Russian hackers are his source. \nIn an upcoming documentary made by Dartmouth Films, Assange speaks of the \u201cClinton camp\u201d putting forth a \u201chysteria that Russia is responsible for everything.\u201d He goes on to say, \u201cHillary Clinton has stated multiple times, falsely, that 17 US intelligence agencies had assessed that Russia was the source of our publications. That\u2019s false \u2014 we can say that the Russian government is not the source.\u201d \nFurthermore, the Kremlin denies Clinton\u2019s claims. Russian presidential press secretary Dmitry Peskov called the claims \u201cnonsense.\u201d While that \u2014 in and of itself \u2014 would not carry much weight, when it is added to the body of evidence that includes Assange denying the Russian connection, the laughably far-fetched lengths to which the Left will got to promote easily debunkable conspiracy theories, the FBI stating that there is \u201cno clear link\u201d between Trump and Russia, and Trump himself denying that he has any dealings with Russia, it\u2019s fairly easy to see that the only thing there is to see here is an imploding campaign by the woman who \u2014 the last time she occupied 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue \u2014 claimed that her husband\u2019s impeachment was the result of a \u201cvast right-wing conspiracy.\u201d \nSome things never change.

Now it\u2019s up to 50 percent, according to this article. \nHell, it\u2019s probably more like 60-70 percent anyway. There is perhaps a hard core of 30 percent of people living in the US who will likely never acknowledge anything wrong with the system or people in power. \nBut for most citizens, we\u2019ve long suggested the current election is destroying the credibility of the ruling classes and their facilities. \nWhatever in government that was supposed to be credible, from the IRS, to the FBI, to the Justice Dept., Congress and the presidency itself, has been visibly damaged by Hillary\u2019s election campaign. \nYou\u2019d have to be virtually blind \u2013 or a staunch partisan of a mythical \u201cUSA\u201d\u2013 not to notice that the Democratic front-runner has committed actions for which anyone else would have been significantly punished. \nAnd not just Hillary of course but those surrounding her including Bill Clinton and the Foundation that allows them to trade political favors for cash. \nThen there\u2019s the mainstream media. The media has investigated little or none of the malfeasance and worse (murders?) surrounding the Clintons, and thus newspapers, magazines and TV, already deprived of viewers and ad revenue, have been further damaged by an obvious, ongoing lack of credibility. \nMore: \nConspiracy theories about the JFK assassination abound, and scientists say these ideas have become embedded in the very culture surrounding his death, with heaps of TV shows, books and movies on them. \n\u201cWe found clear evidence that the United States is a strongly conspiratorial society,\u201d study lead author Christopher Bader, a sociologist at Chapman University in California, said in a statement. \nIn order to denigrate suspicion of the government, the study suggests that people\u2019s views regarding conspiracies have to do with their own emotional makeup. In other words, \u201cparanoid\u201d people believe in \u201cconspiracies.\u201d \nThis canard worked better when the number of those voicing conspiracy theories was in the single digits, according to surveys. When half or more than half of the public begins to believe in them, something else is going on. \nNeither the article nor the study (presumably) acknowledges that the CIA came up with the idea of calling people \u201cconspiracy theorists\u201d if they advance theories that the US government is corrupt and secretly tyrannical. \nThe conduct of this past campaign and the Clinton\u2019s evident criminality has reinforced all that is wrong with the US in the views of many and, additionally, has made it clear that even the deepest suspicions of how the US operates are justified. \nWe can come away with two realizations from this. \nThe first is that despite Hillary\u2019s possible election, the US as a valid and valuable entity is shattered in the eyes of many. This is actually a good development in our view given that the US (and its British controllers) has not been positive for freedom or peace in the world at least since the end of the Civil War. \nThe second conclusion, which is not a popular one but which we have voiced before, is that the disaffection of the American public was SUPPOSED to be heightened by the Hillary campaign. \nThe idea here is that chaos and paranoia is supposed to be endlessly increased until the US, like other nation-states, virtually shatters and more aggressive globalism can be introduced in the wake of the disintegration. \nWestern nation-states currently have strong cultures. These cultures need to be torn down if true globalization is to be introduced. \nThe banking elites of this world, mostly located in the City of London, are determined to introduce this chaos, it seems. In Europe chaos is mounting thanks to the introduction of the artificial \u201cimmigration crisis.\u201d \nIn the US, Hillary has served in the place of immigration, cracking the US culture as thoroughly as millions of young Muslim males. Next on the agenda? Possible economic collapse and \u201cworld-war\u201d style military activities. \nConclusion: Yes, it sounds grim \u2026 and even conspiratorial. But there is much you can do to secure your safety and prosperity \u2013 and that of your family\u2019s and even your community\u2019s. You have to realize the civil society you believe in is vanishing (or never existed). And you have to act.",

        "body_en": "\u2018Conspiracy Vs. Government\u2019 Is Part of an Elite Wave of Propaganda Justifying Violent Repression By - October 31, 2016 \nThe rise of paranoid politics could make America ungovernable \u2013 and the FBI is fuelling the fire \u2026 Nothing can disprove the fears of a paranoiac. Indeed, everything confirms them \u2026 It takes away politicians\u2019 incentive to understand one another and get things done. It says that if you scream loud enough, established norms will buckle under the pressure. And while those norms might be annoying and flawed, we\u2019ll all miss them if they go. \u2013UK Telegraph \nWith US belief in \u201cconspiracy theory\u201d over 50 percent (see our previous article here ) elites are showing increasing concern that they have lost control of their narrative. \nThis article again illustrates elite push back. The article explains that if people grow paranoid about government, then the \u201cnorms\u201d of government will collapse. \nConspiracy theory is called \u201cparanoid politics\u201d in this article but it amounts to the same thing. \nThe article also has parallels to an article we analyzed recently here by Cass Sunstein. His Bloomberg editorial suggested that nothing was more important from a political standpoint than returning \u201ccivility\u201d to Congress and politics generally. \nThis article runs along the same lines: Negative perceptions of the US government can make the process of \u201cgoverning\u201d dysfunctional \nMore: \nTake the \u201cchemtrails\u201d conspiracy theory: the idea that the white trails left behind in the sky by aeroplanes are sinister chemicals dispersed to sterilise or control voters. \nIf a government declares there is \u201cno evidence\u201d of such chemicals, that itself must be clear evidence that there\u2019s something \u201cthey\u201d don\u2019t want us to know. But if that government were to open up an investigation, that too would be incontrovertible proof: \u201cthey\u201d must have found something. \nLet\u2019s reverse this reasoning. Apparently, one can\u2019t question much that government does because skepticism puts government in a no-win situation. \nBetter to accept official pronouncements, then. The only trouble is that almost anything modern Western governments say are lies. \nGovernments aren\u2019t even important these days. The world from what we can tell is run by a small banking elite that controls the awesome power of central banks and the money they print. \nThe trillions available to this small group has allowed it to change the nature of society around the world. \nThe goal is global government and every kind of violence and corruption is employed to achieve it. \nSecrecy is still employed by those creating \u201cone world.\u201d Thus the world is bent on the task of creating global governance while never admitting it. \nBut in the past several decades, the Internet has credibly exposed plans for world government. As a result, people have lost faith in mainstream media, politicians and capitalism itself. \nThis is the reason for the rise in \u201cconspiracy theory\u201d and \u201cparanoid politics.\u201d \nThis is also the reason elites would like to shut down the Internet, or at least control it more thoroughly. \nPart of the push for control involves making a case that the Internet needs to be better regulated and appropriately censored. \nTo this end, elite propaganda has been aimed at justifying various anti-\u2018Net actions. \nOne justification involves the \u201cpopulism versus globalism\u201d meme we\u2019ve covered extensively. (Just use a search engine for the phrase and \u201cDaily Bell.\u201d) \nAnother justification \u2013 another emergent meme \u2013 is that government itself is jeopardized by pervasive distrust. \nOne would think the answer would be to lie less, but this is not the conclusion we\u2019re being furnished. \nBoth Sunstein in his article, and now the argument in this article, show us clearly that the solution to pervasive electoral cyncism and worse is to better control one\u2019s attitude. \nIn other words, paranoia and conspiratorial cynicism need to be damped for government to survive and perform its proper function. \nHere: \nWhy, then, did a seasoned operator like Mr Comey, whose judiciousness was praised by the Clinton campaign through the summer, feel the need to divulge this half-baked and potentially insignificant development before assessing it? There is one answer: fear of the mob. \nThe director of the FBI \u2013 those tough guys who smash in doors and shoot people \u2013 was scared that if he didn\u2019t talk now and the news leaked out, it would confirm every conspiracy theory going about how the agency was in the Clintons\u2019 pocket. In other words, we\u2019ve reached a point in the politics of the world\u2019s most powerful democracy where the appearance of probity matters more than the reality. \nThis is a key point in the article. It is one that fully reveals the cognitive dissonance at the heart of this particular argument. The idea is that government is too delicate to sustain itself in the face of the \u201cmob.\u201d The mob must therefore be silenced or \u201cprobity will matter more than reality.\u201d \nBut who is to determine what constitutes a \u201cmob\u201d? And who is determine that the mob\u2019s \u201creality\u201d is false? \nBoth the Sunstein article and now this one are erecting very specific kinds of arguments. Government, we are told, is fragile and must be protected from forces that will undermine its credibility. \nBut this conclusion is merely assumed. It is never proven. \nThis argument begins and ends with government. Yet the Internet and its recovered history shows us clearly that Western governments mostly provide concealment for the world\u2019s real powers that prefer to operate behind the scenes. \nThis is the reason for so much cynicism. Many have realized that the society constructed around them is lie. They have reacted by distrusting almost anything associated with modern society. \nBut in these articles, we can see the forces being marshaled against this state of mind. The preferred antidote is simply to assert that people\u2019s distrust is corrosive to government authority and democracy generally. \nNo logic bolsters this argument. That\u2019s why it is an emergent elite meme. \nThe goal of an elite meme is to be convincing not truthful. \nAnd if it is not convincing \u2013 and increasingly elite memes are not \u2013 then its function is, anyway, to provide a justification for what we call directed history. These are the authoritarian strategies that elites wish to inflict on the rest of us. \nThis latter meme is an outgrowth of \u201cpopulism versus globalism.\u201d Populists, as we\u2019ve pointed out, are being cast as ignorant, violent and intolerant. The current meme \u2013 let\u2019s call it \u201cconspiracy versus government\u201d\u2013 lumps in conspiracy with populism. \nPopulists, we learn, are apt to adopt an irrational distrust of government. And what is government? It must comprise all that is good and virtuous in an uncivil world. \nBoth populists and conspiracy theory are to be vanquished, eventually, by wise globalists who understand that the absence of government will lead to violent \u201canarchy.\u201d \nWould that it were true. It is not. Government is merely in this day-and-age a curtain hiding the world\u2019s real controllers who use endless violence, monetary debasement and economic depression to get their way. \nConclusion: We are watching the emergence of a new, dangerous memes. Increasingly and forcefully, it is being argued that \u201cgovernment\u201d is good and that the truths people have discovered about their lives and society are destabilizing to government, and therefore \u201cbad.\u201d The idea will be to use these memes to make a case for increased censorship and even, eventually, violent repression \u2013 and worse.",

        "body_en": "Oregon Live \u2013 by Maxine Bernstein \nA federal jury on Thursday found Ammon Bundy, his brother Ryan Bundy and five co-defendants not guilty of conspiring to prevent federal employees from doing their jobs through intimidation, threat or force during the 41-day occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge. \nThe Bundy brothers and occupiers Jeff Banta and David Fry also were found not guilty of having guns in a federal facility. Kenneth Medenbach was found not guilty of stealing government property, and a hung jury was declared on Ryan Bundy\u2019s charge of theft of FBI surveillance cameras. \n\u201cMore than we could have hoped for,\u201d said one of Ammon Bundy\u2019s lawyers, J. Morgan Philpot. \n\u201cStunning,\u201d said defense lawyer Lisa Ludwig, who was standby counsel for Ryan Bundy. \n\u201cI\u2019m just thrilled,\u201d said Neil Wampler\u2019s attorney Lisa Maxfield. \nThe jury of nine women and three men returned the verdicts after five hours of deliberations on Thursday in the high-profile case that riveted the state and drew national and international attention to the federal bird sanctuary in rural eastern Oregon. \nEach defendant stood separately, facing the jury, as the judge read the verdicts. Ammon Bundy, his hands clasped behind his back, nodded as the \u201cnot guilty\u201d verdicts were read for him first. As he sat, he smiled and rubbed the shoulder of his lawyer, Marcus Mumford. \nHis older brother Ryan Bundy stood. As his \u201cnot guilty\u201d verdicts were read, he nodded, and mouthed to the jury, \u201cThank you.\u201d Defendant Neil Wampler hugged and kissed his defense lawyer, Maxfield. \nThe coda to the stunning verdict, undoubtedly a significant blow to federal prosecutors, was when Ammon Bundy\u2019s lawyer Marcus Mumford argued that his client, dressed in a gray suit and white dress shirt, should be allowed to walk out of the court, a free man. \nU.S. District Judge Anna J. Brown told him that there was a U.S. Marshal\u2019s hold on him from a pending federal indictment in Nevada. \nOregon Standoff defendant Jeff Banta is relieved by acquittals \n\u201cIf there\u2019s a detainer, show me,\u201d Mumford stood, arguing before the judge. \nSuddenly, a group of about six U.S. Marshals surrounded Mumford at his defense table. The judge directed them to move back but moments later, the marshals grabbed on to him. \n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Mumford yelled, as he struggled and was taken down to the floor. \nAs deputy marshals yelled, \u201cStop resisting,\u201d the judge demanded, \u201cEverybody out of the courtroom now!\u201d \nMumford was taken into custody, a member of his legal team confirmed. \nAmmon Bundy\u2019s lawyer J. Morgan Philpot, said afterwards on the courthouse steps that Mumford had been arrested and marshals had used a stun gun, or Taser, on his back. Another member of Ammon Bundy\u2019s legal team Rick Koerber, echoed Philpot, saying he heard Mumford questioning in court why they were using a Taser against him. \nPhilpot decried the marshals\u2019 treatment of Mumford in the courtroom. \u201cWhat happened at the end is symbolic of the improper use of force by the federal government,\u201d he said. \nBy 6:30 p.m., Mumford was released from custody. He confirmed that he was struck with a stun gun once while he was on the floor of the courtroom. \n\u201cI grew up on a dairy farm, so am I used to some rough treatment, sure?\u201d he said. But he said the actions of the U.S. marshals were uncalled for. \n\u201cAll I was asking for was papers. Just show me you have the authority to take Mr. Bundy into custody.\u201d \nAs to the verdict, \u201cVery pleased, very gratified. This jury was dedicated. They listened to our case.\u201d \nJust after the verdicts were announced, people emerged onto the front steps of the courthouse to tell a crowd of media and onlookers. \nSupporters of the defendants gathered in a joyous hug. One of them, Brand Thornton of Las Vegas, one of the original occupiers who accompanied Ryan Bundy and others onto the refuge on Jan. 2 and was called as witness by the defense, said that he has been at the trial since Oct. 2. \nThe verdict \u201cmeans everything,\u201d Thornton said. It\u2019s huge for ranchers and land rights within Harney County and across the West, he said. \n\u201cWe did something peaceful and wanted to stay peaceful,\u201d said Thornton, who has kept vigil outside the courthouse, blowing a shofar. \n\u201cThis is for the people of Oregon,\u201d Thornton said. \u201cThis was never for us.\u201d \nWampler appeared on the courthouse steps and described the verdict as a \u201cstunning victory for rural America.\u201d \nDavid Fry\u2019s lawyer Per C. Olson said, \u201cIt was the right result.\u201d \n\u201cI think the jury saw through this that they were well-meaning, well-intentioned individuals,\u201d Olson said. The jury saw that the defendants cared about the Hammonds and didn\u2019t like how the federal government was treating them. \nMaxfield, who represented Wampler, came out of the courthouse, holding up her fists. She said she has never seen \u201canything like this happen,\u201d where multiple defendants in a federal court trial were all acquitted, and called it one of the most significant cases in her career. \nDefendant Shawna Cox said she had a \u201cpeaceful feeling,\u201d as she waited for the verdicts, \u201cbut I didn\u2019t expect we\u2019d all be found not guilty.\u201d \n\u201cI wept,\u201d Cox said. \u201cIt brings me to tears. I\u2019m so grateful to the jury.\u201d \nDefense lawyer Matthew Schindler, standby counsel to defendant Kenneth Medenbach who was excused from court because of medical ailments, said he called his client right away. \n\u201cHe\u2019s been fighting for more than 20 years to be in a situation where a jury acquitted him,\u201d Schindler said. \u201cIt\u2019s vindication.\u201d \nSchindler said he believes the jury\u2019s verdicts resulted from the difficulty the government had in proving that the \u201cintent\u201d of the defendants was to conspire against the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and U.S. Bureau of Land Management. \n\u201cThe judge gave us broad ability to bring in a defendant\u2019s state of mind and what you saw was a number of defendants who each had their own motivations,\u201d Schindler said. \nWhen prosecuting a drug conspiracy, it\u2019s easy to point to what the defendants\u2019 underlying objective is. But in this case, Schindler said, there was \u201cno obvious underlying self interest.\u201d He said the defense also was bolstered because the jurors came from different regions from the state, and not just from Portland. \nOregon U.S. Attorney Billy Williams sat in the back of the courtroom with Oregon\u2019s FBI Special Agent in Charge Gregg Bretzing as the verdicts were read. Williams left the courtroom early, before the scrum with Mumford, to attend a gathering of the League of Minority Voters in Salem Thursday night. \nHarney County Sheriff Dave Ward, who was the face of law enforcement during the 41-day refuge takeover, said in a statement, \u201cWhile I am disappointed in the outcome, I believe our form of government and justice system to be the best in the world. These folks were tried in a court of law and found not guilty by a jury of their peers. This is our system, and I stand by it.\u201d \nThe five-week trial offered a rare display: Three of the seven defendants chose to represent themselves. Five of them were among the more than 80 people who took the witness stand to testify. \nAnd one of the original 12 jurors was dismissed after a fellow juror raised concerns about his impartiality four days into an initial round of deliberations \u2013 what the judge called an \u201cextraordinary circumstance.\u201d An alternate juror was summoned to begin a new round of deliberations with the remaining 11 jurors Thursday morning. \nThere was heightened security in and around the courthouse throughout the trial, with security officers ordered to wear bulletproof vests, and metal detectors set up outside the main trial courtroom and an overflow room with a live video feed of the proceedings. \nOften, supporters knelt in prayer in the courthouse corridor before the trial began in the mornings, and some kept vigil across the street, with one fellow occupier blowing a ram\u2019s horn, or shofar, as the jury deliberated. \nPENDING PROSECUTIONS \nThe seven on trial were among 26 people indicted on the conspiracy charge. \nEleven of them pleaded guilty to the conspiracy charge. \nSeven others are set for trial on Feb. 14, but their cases may be affected by the verdicts. If convictions are handed down in this case, then defendants scheduled for trial in February might consider potential pleas. If there are acquittals, prosecutors may rethink going to trial on same charges against co-defendants next year. \nOn the eve of jury selection in this case, prosecutors agreed to dismiss the conspiracy charge against Pete Santilli, an independent broadcaster and self-described \u201cshock jock,\u201d who provided live stream footage of the occupation. \nNEVADA CASE \nAmmon Bundy and Ryan Bundy also face prosecution in Nevada in the 2014 standoff with federal agents over the impounding of their father\u2019s cattle near Bunkerville, Nevada. \nThe trial there is set to start Feb. 6. The two brothers and father Cliven Bundy are among 19 indicted in Nevada. Others from the Oregon refuge occupation also indicted on federal charges in Nevada are Pete Santilli, Ryan Payne, Brian Cavalier, Blaine Cooper and Joseph O\u2019Shaughnessy. \nPayne pleaded guilty to the federal conspiracy charge in Oregon under a potential global agreement that was in the works with Nevada prosecutors, but he recently asked to withdraw the Oregon plea because no deal was reached in Nevada. Prosecutors in Portland have until Oct. 31 to respond. \nCooper entered guilty pleas in both cases. O\u2019Shaughnessy pleaded guilty in the Oregon case, with a deal pending in Nevada. Cavalier pleaded guilty in the Oregon case. \n\u2014 Maxine Bernstein",

        "body_en": "Nov 4 Nov 4 Civil War In FBI As Patriot Agents Battle Corrupt Obama/Clinton Cabal Trying To Cover Up Regime Crimes, Obstruct Justice \nThe Guardian \nDeep antipathy to Hillary Clinton exists within the FBI, multiple bureau sources have told the Guardian, spurring a rapid series of leaks damaging to her campaign just days before the election. \nCurrent and former FBI officials, none of whom were willing or cleared to speak on the record, have described a chaotic internal climate that resulted from outrage over director James Comey\u2019s July decision not to recommend an indictment over Clinton\u2019s maintenance of a private email server on which classified information transited. \n\u201cThe FBI is Trumpland,\u201d said one current agent. \nThis atmosphere raises major questions about how Comey and the bureau he is slated to run for the next seven years can work with Clinton should she win the White House. \nThe currently serving FBI agent said Clinton is \u201cthe antichrist personified to a large swath of FBI personnel,\u201d and that \u201cthe reason why they\u2019re leaking is they\u2019re pro-Trump.\u201d \nThe agent called the bureau \u201cTrumplandia\u201d, with some colleagues openly discussing voting for a GOP nominee who has garnered unprecedented condemnation from the party\u2019s national security wing and who has pledged to jail Clinton if elected. \nAt the same time, other sources dispute the depth of support for Trump within the bureau, though they uniformly stated that Clinton is viewed highly unfavorably. \n\u201cThere are lots of people who don\u2019t think Trump is qualified, but also believe Clinton is corrupt. What you hear a lot is that it\u2019s a bad choice, between an incompetent and a corrupt politician,\u201d said a former FBI official. \nSources who disputed the depth of Trump\u2019s internal support agreed that the FBI is now in parlous political territory. Justice department officials \u2013 another current target of FBI dissatisfaction \u2013 have said the bureau disregarded longstanding rules against perceived or actual electoral interference when Comey wrote to Congress to say it was reviewing newly discovered emails relating to Clinton\u2019s personal server.",

Bush \u201clost\u201d 22 million emails, many involving criminal investigations, and the FBI has said nothing, though the emails involved the White House used an illegal private server owned by the Republican Party for official government business. \nThe FBI is out to get Hillary Clinton, it\u2019s not Director Comey, Obama put him in there to clean up the mess, they\u2019ve been after Obama for 8 years. The \u2018birther\u2019 hoax began, no we aren\u2019t kidding, inside the FBI \u2013 it was the FBI that originated the wild rumour that Hillary Clinton murdered Vince Foster and that President Obama is not only a Muslim but many in the FBI actually say he\u2019s the anti-christ. \nLegal Analyst Paul Callan of CNN just published the following: \nLately, the FBI, while acting without the customary supervision of the Justice Department, appears to be a runaway train on a collision course with the concept of fairness in next week\u2019s presidential election. Democratic Senator Harry Reid and former White House ethics counsel Richard Painter have accused FBI Director James Comey of violating the Hatch Act by illegally using his office to influence the election. While the claim of a Hatch Act violation is a stretch, the appointment of an independent prosecutor and the replacement of Comey are nonetheless urgently required, if not outright overdue. The tangled relationship between the Clintons and Attorney General Loretta Lynch should have prompted appointment of an independent special prosecutor long ago.. \nHere\u2019s what Callan knew but wasn\u2019t able to write. The same informants that went to Callan also came to us and what they had to say was frightening. Here is how it began; an FBI insurrection and this is the exact term used by sources deep inside the FBI cabal, an FBI insurrection against, Comey, Hillary Clinton and Obama can no longer be safely ignored. This is why Senator Harry Reid has called for a criminal investigation of the FBI for violation of the Hatch Act. \nThe FBI, and this isn\u2019t Comey, it is the rank and file, the insurrectionist rank and file, a very powerful organisation that includes case managers, deputy directors that run not only counter-terrorism but financial crimes as well have not only targeted what they see to be dangerous liberal and progressive leaders, including of course the American president, but have continually protected criminals from prosecution as well. Those they have protected, possibly including names like Adelson, Trump and Romney, are funding moves against the US government, moves against American foreign policy and may well actually be funding recognised terror organisations as well, we have been specifically told this by sources within the FBI. \nThis insurrectional group within the FBI, which we are told includes the majority of FBI agents, has little idea what they have gotten into, some are aware they are taking orders from the shadowy Federalist Society, that \u2018right-wing conspiracy\u2019 Hillary Clinton referred to so many years ago as trying to bring down her husband\u2019s presidency, but it goes deeper, it gets scarier; it isn\u2019t just \u2018birthers\u2019. \nThe public face of this is blocked court appointments and a government in paralysis, but it\u2019s far deeper and far more threatening, it all became possible when two branches of government fell under the control of organised crime. It took a five/four rigged Supreme Court and a rigged election in 2000, covered up by the FBI, to subvert for all times the independence of America\u2019s legislature. Rigged by Richard Mellon Scaife, funded by Sheldon Adelson, a cabal calling themselves \u2018Neocons\u2019, in reality a front for organised crime, reapportioned Congressional districts across the US in clear violation of equal protection provisions of the constitution and backed by five mob-controlled members of the Supreme Court, bolstered by vote flipping software from the CIA, control of the legislative/investigative branch of government was permanently placed in the hands of a minority, destroying any hope of separation of powers and undermining all constitutional protections. Any hope of Americans influencing their own destiny disappeared with a rigged legislature running endless witch hunts and a mob-controlled Supreme Court backing them up. \nMaking it worse, so much worse, was the creation of a massive security bureaucracy, the Department of Homeland Security, laws authorising torture and illegal surveillance and the destruction of the FBI. \nNo public scandal can be investigated, no regulation enforced, no-one is left to speak up, no-one is safe from illegal arrest and imprisonment, a nightmare from the pages of Kafka become reality, all this has become clear in the last few days. \nWhen a prominent US senator calls for the prosecution of America\u2019s national police force, is it perhaps time to take note? \nThere was a reason the constitution prohibited the creation of the national police force, just as the constitution prohibited the creation of a central bank; there is no mechanism capable of controlling a central bank, as the failures of the Federal Reserve board and a cursory study of American history since 1913 will establish. \nSimilarly, no provision was established within the constitution to regulate or oversee a national police force, it didn\u2019t take long for the FBI to become the Cheka within a short period after it\u2019s creation, J. Edgar Hoover, turned \u2018the bureau\u2019 into a monstrosity blackmailing politicians and cosying up to crime figures while Hoover\u2019s FBI chased \u2018commies\u2019 both real and imaginary, it protected not only the mafia but powerful international crime cartels as well, becoming the real \u2018Murder Inc.\u2019 Taxpayer financed strong-arm thugs supported by a disinformation campaign. \nHoover gained control of the press almost immediately, keeping files on his press enemies, threatening and blackmailing; some of this was to protect his own secrets \u2013 mob ties and his notorious penchant for sexual deviance, now long in the public domain, but it went further \u2013 it was all about power. \n\u2018Mary\u2019 Hoover liked to dress as a woman and was infamously covertly photographed along with his longtime companion and lover Clyde Tolson in flagrante delicto; those photographs came into the possession of mob kingpin Meyer Lansky, thus ensnaring Hoover, and by extension the entire FBI in a dangerous marriage with the mob. There is no evidence they ever got divorced, though from time to time the relationship may have been somewhat rocky. \nSimply put, given these facts, any sense of surprise at FBI misconduct or calls for investigating or even disbanding the FBI, should be no surprise to anyone. Nearly every current television series that features scenarios involving the FBI invariably focuses on FBI corruption, the FBI\u2019s illegal involvement in politics and gross incompetence. \nSit at a table and have lunch with the FBI, it can go one of two ways \u2013 you can have brilliant, dedicated and relentless law enforcement officers who complain about being shackled by a corrupt bureaucracy, or like as not, a pack of delusional nutcases mouthing wild conspiracy theories and ranting about dangerous liberals; neither group, though widely divergent, make a case for the survival of the FBI. Then when you realise the Dept. of Homeland Security is entirely composed of conspiracy nutcases and other agencies are worse, it becomes clear that Harry Reid\u2019s demand to clean up the FBI is far from enough.",

Poor Carville was clearly apoplectic at the news of Comey\u2019s announcement, describing it as an assault or attack on American democracy multiple times. \n\nHe was also adamant about who was responsible. \u201cComey was acting in concert and coordination with the House Republicans,\u201d Carville said. \u201cWe also have the extraordinary case of the KGB being involved in this race and selectively leaking things from the Clinton campaign that they hacked,\u201d he claimed. \nCarville was very upset that Comey\u2019s announcement thrust Clinton\u2019s surely unethical and likely illegal behavior back into the spotlight. \u201cIt would seem to me that the FBI shouldn\u2019t be getting rolled by the House Republicans, that\u2019s what happened here \u2014 there\u2019s nothing else that\u2019s going on \u2014 and in the meantime \u2026 democracy is under assault by the KGB,\u201d he said. \u201cTo me that\u2019s something we ought to be talking about.\u201d \n\nUnfortunately for Carville, whilst fanciful tales about time-traveling Soviet spies and an FBI on the GOP\u2019s take certainly make for interesting entertainment, they pale in importance to the real life stories of Clinton\u2019s brazen lawlessness. \nWhen the MSNBC anchor dared raise the fact that Democrats were praising Comey only a few months ago when he announced the FBI\u2019s decision not to recommend indictment, Carville went into a stuttering, sputtering fit. Hillary Reboots \u2018Vast Right-Wing Conspiracy\u2019 Playbook Clinton camp set to wage effort to discredit FBI Director Comey and criminal probe as politically motivated \n\n\u201cWhen the facts change I change my mind,\u201d Carville said. \u201cWhy are you defending this, why are you sitting here as American democracy is under assault?\u201d he asked angrily. Faced with the Democrats\u2019 clear double standard \n\n\u201cThis is an unprecedented event that was done on behalf of the House Republicans,\u201d Carville repeated. \u201cAnd as we know the KGB is all over this election and this is what we are talking about? We ought to be talking about our democracy is under assault right now and what we are going to do about it, not [what somebody said in July] about James Comey.\u201d",

        "body_en": "Print \nHmm, how about that? Eleven days before the game-changing 2016 presidential election, FBI Director James Comey announces that his agency is reopening the criminal investigation of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton . \nAll of the expected angst and apoplexy from the Left come gushing out. An anti-Trump PAC issues a complaint against the FBI for interfering with the eletoral process . Better still, the Clinton campaign issues a statement via \u2014 of all people \u2014 its chairman, John Podesta. In it, Podesta accuses Comey of bending to presure brought by \u201cDonald Trump and his Republican allies\u201d regarding the director\u2019s initial determination that no indictment against the former secretary of state should be brought. \nPodesta\u2019s prepared remarks also paraphrase Comey\u2019s declaration in July that \u201cno reasonable prosecutor would move forward with a case like this,\u201d which at the time prompted much head-scratching since he also affirmed that Clinton had indeed sent and received classified information using her non-secured private email account . \nCall me a conspiracy theorist if you like \u2014 my colleague Benny Huang probably would \u2014 but I have to wonder whether all this is too convenient. Could we be witnessing a calculated plan to divert attention from the WikiLeaks emails, which have been hurting the Democratic candidate\u2019s standing in the polls? This development might even gain some sympathy for Hillary Clinton, who has long maintained the vast right-wing conspiracy \u2014 which, nota bene, includes James Comey \u2014 has it out for the Clintons. \nOr better yet, suppose that the FBI does put a rush on its investigation, as Clinton herself has now demanded, and determines for a second time that there are no grounds for an indictment. \nAll the while, the press and impressionable voters would be focused on this probe. Envelope, please !",

The latest accuser is longtime Democratic strategist James Carville. \nAs reported by Edund Kozak for PoliZette , in an appearance on MSNBC yesterday, Oct. 31, 2016, Carville attacked the FBI for reopening its criminal investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails, calling it part of a vast conspiracy to subvert American democracy. (See \u201c Weinered: FBI reopens investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails \u201d) \nCarville raged: \n\u201cThis is in effect an attempt to hijack an election.

Agents scrutinized advisers close to Donald J. Trump, looked for financial connections with Russian financial figures, searched for those involved in hacking the computers of Democrats, and even chased a lead \u2014 which they ultimately came to doubt \u2014 about a possible secret channel of email communication from the Trump Organization to a Russian bank. \nLaw enforcement officials say that none of the investigations so far have found any link between Mr. Trump and the Russian government. And even the hacking into Democratic emails, F.B.I. and intelligence officials now believe, was aimed at disrupting the presidential election rather than electing Mr. Trump.\u201d \nHey, James Carville, you conniving POS.

ARREST THEM ALL: Clinton, Podesta, Abedin, Lynch, Mook, Stephanopoulos and all the co-conspirators \n  Clinton corruption , John Podesta , crime family (NaturalNews) It's not just that the corruption and criminality of the Clintons knows no bounds; it's also that the democrat political machine trying to thrust her into power also has total disregard for democracy, truth and ethics. Their mission? Put our nation's worst political criminal into the White House by any means necessary, including systematic lying, fraud, money laundering, intimidation of opponents and even murder of those who might testify against her. The Clinton machine is a mafia operation , and every person involved in it must go to jail.That includes not just the deep operatives like Podesta, Lynch and Abedin, but also all the deep cover Clinton operatives pretending to be journalists , including Stephanopoulos, Maddow, Hayes, Milbank and all the rest ( see the list here ). Every one of these people has committed crimes of sedition against the United States of America and is guilty of attempting to defraud democracy, steal the election, and place a mafia criminal into power at the highest level of government through the deliberate pursuit of journalistic malpractice . Seditious Clinton operatives must be arrested and put behind bars to protect America We the People are beyond the stage of merely wanting to vote you out of power and turn off your broadcast networks. It's now time to seek your indictment and imprisonment so that you cannot be allowed to harm this society ever again.Every operative, journalist and co-conspirator with the Clinton Foundation, the Clinton corruption and the Clinton murders must be arrested, indicted and, if found guilty by a fair trial, sent to prison. This nation needs to heal itself from the Clinton nightmare , and the only way that's going to happen is if the criminal traitors, sellouts and corrupt backstabbers are marched away in handcuffs and put behind bars.\"A former FBI official said Sunday that Bill and Hillary Clinton are part of a \u0093crime family\u0094 and argued top officials hindered the investigation into Hillary Clinton\u0092s private email server while she was secretary of State,\" reports TheHill.com : Kallstrom, best known for leading the investigation into the explosion of TWA flight 800 in the late '90s, said that Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, was a \u0093pathological liar.\u0094He also blasted Attorney General Loretta Lynch, claiming that she impeded the investigation into Clinton\u0092s private server.\u0093The problem here is this investigation was never a real investigation,\u0094 he said. \u0093That\u0092s the problem. They never had a grand jury empanelled, and the reason they never had a grand jury empanelled, I\u0092m sure, is Loretta Lynch would not go along with that.\u0094 \u0093God forbid we put someone like that in the White House,\u0094 he added of Clinton.Kallstrom also said that FBI Director James Comey and the rest of the FBI\u0092s leadership were responsible for holding back the investigation, not the rest of the bureau.\u0093The agents are furious with what\u0092s going on, I know that for a fact,\u0094 he said. Corrupt, pro-Clinton \"journalists\" should not be given any quarter in all this. Much like the propagandists of the Third Reich, they abuse their positions of power to operate in conspiracy with an outright criminal who acts against the interests of the American people. Did you know that Hillary Clinton sold off uranium mining rights to the Russians because the oligarchs who made billions off the deal turned around and donated millions to her Clinton Foundation? If you aren't aware of this, you need to watch Clinton Cash immediately . The simple truth is that the entire democrat party is a massive criminal cartel What America has now come to realize via the Wikileaks email dumps , the Project Veritas undercover videos and even the revelations of former FBI agents who know what's really happening inside the agency is that the entire democrat party is a massive criminal cartel .From the DNC (which actively conspired to sideline Bernie Sanders during the nomination process) to the left-wing media (which coordinates false smear attacks against Donald Trump), every element of the democrat party is hopelessly corrupt. Democrat political operatives abide by no laws, no ethics and no boundaries. They lie, cheat and steal their way into power at every election... and they're desperately trying to steal this election, too.It's not just that the Clinton crime family must be taken down, you see: It's that the entire democrat establishment should be disbanded or imprisoned . There isn't a high-level operative inside the DNC who isn't committing election fraud on a daily basis. The coordination and collusion, money laundering and pay-to-play \"influence for sale\" schemes are all illegal, yet they are the very foundation of the democrat establishment as it exists today.Every one of these people needs to be arrested, indicted and imprisoned. This is the only way genuine democracy can be restored across America. Aside from their criminality, democrats' policy ideas just don't work Even on policy alone, democrats are total failures . None of their ideas or policies actually work. Look at Obamacare, with its insurance costs now doubling every 2-3 years , with coverage options crashing nationwide and the entire failed idea now on the verge of imploding. This was hailed as an historic solution by Obama and the rest of the dummocrats who forced it through Congress and the Supreme Court. In reality, Obamacare was the dumbest idea ever attempted to solve the health care crisis, and I called it that from its inception.Democrats are parasites on society who know nothing other than how to survive as government blood suckers by promising big ideas that routinely fail. They confiscate money from taxpayers, waste it on the most stupid policy ideas ever dreamed up, while siphoning off billions for their own salaries, bonuses and luxurious lifestyles. Then, if you oppose their complete idiocy, they invoke the IRS to have you audited or arrested. This is Amerika today under Obama and the Clintons.This racket must end. The Clintons and all their co-conspirators must be sent to prison. Donald Trump is right when he says this is \"Bigger than Watergate.\" There's no comparison. The crimes of the Clintons are a thousand times larger and more damning to democracy than anything Richard Nixon ever attempted. Corrupt leftist media still lying every hour in a desperate attempt to defeat Trump While all this is happening, the corrupt leftist media -- Washington Post, New York Times, MSNBC, CNN, Google News, Yahoo News, etc. -- has long since abandoned any pretense of engaging in journalism and is now all-in for the Clinton criminal mafia.They have thrown their reputations to the wind, betting everything on the most corrupt criminal to ever seek the office of the presidency. They're bleeding readers and viewers by the millions as fed-up Americans change the channels or turn off their cable TV altogether (who needs politicized ESPN, anyway?) to seek out more accurate news online from sites like Natural News and Breitbart.com .Even the mass censorship of political trends by Facebook and Twitter can't stop the avalanche of awakening now sweeping across America. Across every sector of society, the American people are saying ENOUGH IS ENOUGH! We will not allow the criminal democrats to steal this election and install a totalitarian dictator into the White House.We will vote against the establishment in record numbers. We will overwhelm the fraud, out-vote the brain-dead leftists and achieve a landslide victory for Donald Trump.And if the corrupt, criminal democrats still fake the numbers, bribe the electoral voters or commit massive fraud to steal the election, We the People will take to the streets and take our democracy back . We the People will NOT accept a Clinton presidency under these conditions of massive fraud, collusion and extreme media bias Based on everything we are seeing right now, there is no scenario under which Hillary Clinton will be accepted as the legitimate victor of this election. In no way has this been an open, fair and free election. It has been a warped, one-sided exercise in media collusion that isn't fooling anyone.In the minds of the real American people, Hillary Clinton is done for . The People will not stand for more corruption, collusion and criminals running our system. The revolt has begun , and it will sweep through the voting booths, the electorate and if necessary, the very streets of America to demand an end to the failed, corrupt political establishment run by sinister criminals who belong behind bars.Get ready, my friends, to take this country back. First, vote for Donald Trump as a vote against corruption and collusion of the leftist establishment.Secondly, demand the arrest of all Clinton-linked operatives , including those in the leftist lying media.Thirdly, do not tolerate the theft of your democracy by corrupt Clinton operatives who are trying to steal this election. If they steal the votes or steal the Electoral College outcome, prepare to march in the streets to take your country back .Yes, I'm calling for peaceful mass protests, everywhere across America, if the criminal democrats and corrupt leftist media steal this election through fraud. Bring plenty of rope because you may have to swing across moats and scale the walls of the castle to finally reach the inner layers of corruption and criminality in Washington D.C. (That's a metaphor, for the dumb-as-dirt left-wing media journalists who are too stupid to parse a sentence.) DEFEAT Clinton now or lose America to a totalitarian regime that will never let go of absolute power This is your LAST CHANCE to take America back. If you allow the Clintons and the corrupt democrats to seize power through widespread fraud and theft, there will never be an open, fair and free election in America ever again . All opponents of Clinton will be imprisoned or executed. All conservative media outlets will be taken offline or silenced. The borders will be opened to a massive wave of illegal aliens from all across the world, and they will overrun and occupy America, destroying it from within while the bigoted, intolerant democrats turn the entire nation into a \"sanctuary nation\" where illegals have absolute immunity while patriots are executed or imprisoned by the millions.That's the \"American Holocaust\" you're going to be witnessing if you allow these criminals -- Clinton, Abedin, Podesta, Stephanopoulos and all the rest -- to remain in power. Throw them behind bars if you want to see your country survive the next four years .",

        "body_en": "By Gordon Duff, Senior Editor on November 3, 2016 Hoover and Tolson \nWhen Supreme Court Justice John Scalia died, under mysterious circumstances, FBI officials were there. It was the FBI that blocked the autopsy of a Supreme Court Justice, required by law to be supervised by the Surgeon General of the United States. \nThe organization Scalia belonged to and was with when he died, or was murdered as some assert, includes top leaders of all American business sectors along with government officials, both elected and \u201ccareer,\u201d who regularly meet and plan the overthrow of the American government. \nThe Trump team includes the public persona of Rudy Guiliani, tasked with organizing the FBI revolt, wielding bushels of cash from the Saudis and the Adelson gambling/trafficking empire. Guiliani and his friends control most post-retirement employment for FBI agents, all of which filters through firms connected to or represented by his law firm. The FBI is, in fact, controlled by Rudy Guiliani, according to some sources. \nWe saw the tip of that this week when Rudy Guiliani, according to the Daily Beast , reached inside the FBI and moved them clearly into the Trump campaign. Illegal though these acts are, as you may read below, they openly bragged about it. You see, with Congress and the FBI under control, investigations are a tool of punishment and intimidation only: \n\u201cTwo days before FBI director James Comey rocked the world last week, Rudy Giuliani was on Fox, where he volunteered, un-prodded by any question: \u201cI think he\u2019s [Donald Trump] got a surprise or two that you\u2019re going to hear about in the next few days. I mean, I\u2019m talking about some pretty big surprises.\u201d Pressed for specifics, he said: \u201cWe\u2019ve got a couple of things up our sleeve that should turn this thing around.\u201d \nThe man who now leads \u201clock-her-up\u201d chants at Trump rallies spent decades of his life as a federal prosecutor and then mayor working closely with the FBI, and especially its New York office. One of Giuliani\u2019s security firms employed a former head of the New York FBI office, and other alumni of it. It was agents of that office, probing Anthony Weiner\u2019s alleged sexting of a minor, who pressed Comey to authorize the review of possible Hillary Clinton-related emails on a Weiner device that led to the explosive letter the director wrote Congress. \nHours after Comey\u2019s letter about the renewed probe was leaked on Friday, Giuliani went on a radio show and attributed the director\u2019s surprise action to \u201cthe pressure of a group of FBI agents who don\u2019t look at it politically.\u201d \n\u2018The other rumor that I get is that there\u2019s a kind of revolution going on inside the FBI about the original conclusion [not to charge Clinton] being completely unjustified and almost a slap in the face to the FBI\u2019s integrity,\u201d said Giuliani. \u201cI know that from former agents. I know that even from a few active agents.'\u201d \nKey to understanding the problem is understanding the nature of the \u201cindependence\u201d of the FBI. Established at a time when organized crime ran rampant across the nation, the FBI, operating outside any constitutional authority and in direct contravention of constitutional law, grew from small number of unarmed legal consultants to a government within the government. \nWith the advent of World War II, the FBI grew to massive strength and began operating around the world. They were given broad powers to mete out justice, unlimited powers of search and arrest, of surveillance and even summary execution when they deemed in the national interest. \nWith the Cold War, the FBI rode the Red Menace scare to infinite power while partnering with organized crime. J. Edgar Hoover often denied that organized crime existed and was later to have been discovered a victim of blackmail at the hands of Meyer Lansky. From VT: \n\u201cNo provision was established within the constitution to regulate or oversee a national police force, it didn\u2019t take long for the FBI to become the Cheka within a short period after it\u2019s creation, J. Edgar Hoover, turned \u2018the bureau\u2019 into a monstrosity blackmailing politicians and cozying up to crime figures while Hoover\u2019s FBI chased \u2018commies\u2019 both real and imaginary, it protected not only the mafia but powerful international crime cartels as well, becoming the real \u2018Murder Inc.\u2019 Taxpayer financed strong-arm thugs supported by a disinformation campaign. \nHoover gained control of the press almost immediately, keeping files on his press enemies, threatening and blackmailing; some of this was to protect his own secrets \u2013 mob ties and his notorious penchant for sexual deviance, now long in the public domain, but it went further \u2013 it was all about power. \n\u2018Mary\u2019 Hoover liked to dress as a woman and was infamously covertly photographed along with his longtime companion and lover Clyde Tolson in flagrante delicto; those photographs came into the possession of mob kingpin Meyer Lansky, thus ensnaring Hoover, and by extension the entire FBI in a dangerous marriage with the mob. There is no evidence they ever got divorced, though from time to time the relationship may have been somewhat rocky.\u201d \nWith the Watergate scandals, the FBI made the case for being made \u201cunanswerable\u201d to executive authority, even the President or Attorney General. Instead, their only oversight is within the House of Representatives. \nHowever, with the Tea Party takeover of the House, financed by gambling boss Sheldon Adelson, and based on illegal reapportionment of the House districts, defended by a radicalized Supreme Court in continual 5/4 deadlock, the House got out of control, running continual investigations based on internet rumors and conspiracy theories. \nToo offset their zeal and insanity, a well run FBI might well have investigated the House itself, finding drug and gambling/human trafficking funds filling its coffers, opened and placed above the law by the 5/4 Citizens United Supreme Court ruling that legalized unlimited unaccounted offshore funds used to bribe officials. \nAccording to informants, this cabal, including FBI and Pentagon officials, has discussed assassinations of American leaders, military and intelligence support for terror groups and maintains strong ties, through Cuba, with the drug cartels of Mexico and Columbia. \nWhen the Oregon \u201cStandoff\u201d defendants were found \u201cnot guilty,\u201d it was the FBI that scuttled the case because it was the FBI, through informants that run the majority of the violent anti-government supremacist/anti-Semitic groups, that planned the takeover of Federal land at gunpoint. \nFrom a Spencer Ackerman article in the UK Guardian, November 3, 2016 \nOne agent called the bureau \u2018Trumplandia,\u2019 with some colleagues openly discussing voting for the Republican nominee. \nDeep antipathy to Hillary Clinton exists within the FBI, multiple bureau sources have told the Guardian, spurring a rapid series of leaks damaging to her campaign just days before the election. Current and former FBI officials, none of whom were willing or cleared to speak on the record, have described a chaotic internal climate that resulted from outrage over director James Comey\u2019s July public decision not to recommend indictment over Clinton\u2019s maintenance of a private email server on which classified information transited. \n\u201cThe FBI is Trumpland,\u201d said one current agent. \nThis atmosphere raises major questions about how Comey and the bureau he is slated to run for the next seven years can work with Clinton should she win the White House. \nThe currently serving FBI agent said Clinton is \u201cthe antichrist personified to a large swath of FBI personnel,\u201d and that \u201cthe reason why they\u2019re leaking is they\u2019re pro-Trump.\u201d \nThe agent called the bureau \u201cTrumplandia,\u201d with some colleagues openly discussing voting for a GOP nominee who has garnered unprecedented condemnation from the party\u2019s national-security wing and who has pledged to jail Clinton if elected. \nOn the other side is the Pentagon. The conspiracy theories and rumors are still flying about \u201cBarksdale/Minot.\u201d Back in 2006, a B52 took off from Minot Air Force Base with a full load of hydrogen bombs. They were \u201cillegally\u201d or \u201cimproperly\u201d authorized and were being flown out of the United States, we are told, to Diego Garcia. \nSince that time, hundreds of officers, including the entire American nuclear command, have been replaced. We have it on reliable authority, at the highest levels, that officers inside the Pentagon, many recruited into religious extremist organizations operating at the service academies, West Point, Annapolis and the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, had been channeled into positions of authority by a religious cult that sprung up in the early 1980s at the Presidio, a one time Army base in San Francisco, California. \nAmong the founders of that movement were General Paul Vallely, who along with Michael Aquino (rank unknown at this time), founded America\u2019s psychological warfare capability but also founded the Temple of Set, a Satanic cult that spread through the American military. Remember, it was the FBI that in 1992 declared that the ritual satanic killings of the 1970s and 80s including the alleged abuses on 15 military bases tied to the Temple of Set, were only \u201cconspiracy theories.\u201d \nIt is Vallely\u2019s group, Stand Up America, that has attracted so many pro-Trump FBI agents. This is one of the paths that tie the FBI to the Pentagon, through Montana\u2019s \u201cpatriot elites,\u201d many military and intelligence contractors, all right wing, many anti-government and all closet militia backers. \nBefore that, it was the FBI\u2019s SSAIC (Supervising Special Agent In Charge) from the FBI\u2019s massive Los Angeles office, Ted Gunderson, that the fight against ritual abuse and human trafficking that led to a series of quashed investigations that led into the highest levels of Washington. After his retirement,Gunderson went on a personal crusade against the FBI for covering up ritual child abuse. Gunderson was approached by a number of informants and volunteers, who turned out to be his undoing. Two came to live with him, Tim XXXX and Stew XXXX, who looted his files and turned them over to the FBI. \nThese individuals, who still work with the InfoWars organization run by Alex Jones, a Trump advisor and confidant, who also helped organize the Oregon Standoff. \nConclusion \nWe are told that we have at least 100 FBI agents who have submitted resignations if Hillary Clinton is not arrested. They claim, we are told by former Representative Tom Delay, they have extensive knowledge of her case and a coverup within the FBI. \nOnly a few short years ago, the same story of FBI resignations was based on another assertion, that the FBI was involved in a criminal coverup of President Obama\u2019s foreign birth. \nWhat we do know is this, the FBI is not just politicized. They are working hand in hand with obstructionists in congress, adding to the legislative abuses of separation of powers something far more sinister. The FBI is abusing the justice system as well, fabricating evidence, planting emails, intimidating witnesses, quashing investigations and openly involving themselves in the political process. \nThere is currently NO public confidence in the FBI, in its director and, similarly, there is no public confidence in rank and file agents as well. The barrel is all rotten apples, there is nothing else but. \nPresident Obama has cited the FBI for politically oriented leaks. We fear that Obama, who should be obligated to act, with do nothing out of fear of being accused of \u201cleadership.\u201d \nWe wonder what he has to lose.",

        "body_en": "By Gordon Duff, Senior Editor on November 2, 2016 By Gordon Duff, Senior Editor and Ian Greenhalgh, Managing Editor \nSources within the FBI have informed VT that a cabal tied to right wing extremists, in particular General Paul Vallely\u2019s Stand Up America (advocating the violent overthrow of the American government) and the Federalist Society along with groups like St. Hubertus and Bilderberg, now run the rank and file of the FBI. The FBI is now a key component of the secret societies that John F. Kennedy warned about. When top DC insiders meet with oil and defense contractors, be it a \u201cprayer breakfast\u201d or \u201chunting society\u201d or to dance around a fire somewhere wearing horned headgear, the FBI is there. \nCalls for a special prosecutor to investigate possible FBI involvement in attempts to rig this years presidential election have more to them than meet the eye. A culture of corruption has infected the FBI to the point where they have become a danger to national security. Let\u2019s be clear, the majority of FBI agents are not only competent and honest, they are fine people. However, this is a deeply political group, strongly right wing, with a very secretive hierarchy that has not only taken sides in the election, but has been involved in covering up terrorist acts and organized crime for years. \nRecently, CNN called for a special prosecutor to investigate the FBI. There is a reason for this, which we will get into, not at some small risk. CNN also reported on \u201cfake news\u201d and the threat it entails. What if I told you that the majority of FBI agents, including highest level officials, were not only \u201cbirthers,\u201d a belief even Trump now has backed away from, but openly talk about murders they believe Hillary Clinton has committed or continue to insist that President Obama is a Muslim? Worse still, many actually insist that Barack Obama is the anti-Christ. \nNot only are those who run America\u2019s most powerful law enforcement organization rooted in conspiracy theories and delusions, they are continually hoaxed by fake news stories. \nWorse still, the FBI has, for years, covered for financial criminals, the payday loan scams, the mortgage \u201crobo-signers\u201d and more. When America\u2019s savings and loans were crashed by fraud during the Reagan administration, costing $1.4 trillion, few went to jail. This may have been the beginning. When, in 2007, America\u2019s investment banking system collapsed, the price of that nearing $10 trillion, all of which involved criminal fraud on an unimaginable scale, all that could be done was a \u201cbail out,\u201d but no prosecutions though nearly half the equity value of the entire nation had been redirected overseas by an international criminal cabal. \nThis is the same FBI, under the guidance of Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, that got behind torture, kidnapping and illegal surveillance. \nWhere we are now is this, organized crime at the highest levels is free to operate in the US with impunity while the FBI runs political witch hunts under the direction of right wing extremist groups. \nWe are told that the FBI helped squash the 9/11 investigations, including releasing certain suspects tied to foreign intelligence services along with a series of investigations tied to voter intimidation, voting machine hacking and the death of Michael Connell , which would have brought down the Bush presidency. \nRead today\u2019s New York Times about Donald Trump\u2019s income taxes, where the term \u201cimproper\u201d is used when describing Trump\u2019s taking huge tax deductions for losses by others. Even the Times is afraid of using the term \u201ccriminal.\u201d It isn\u2019t Trump they are afraid of. Gambling boss Sheldon Adelson just gave Trump $25m today, dirty money to bolster a flagging campaign, donated after the FBI attempt to down Clinton with a phony email scandal failed miserably due to VT investigative reporting . \nVT\u2019s allegations have now all been supported, and sources are coming forward about much more serious problems within the FBI and real threats to national security. \nThe Federalists \nThere is both a public and private version of the Federalist Society. They organize high school debates, the recruit \u201clike minded conservatives\u201d to go to law school or in law schools, they push \u201cright minded\u201d lawyers into key positions in politics, in the courts and in the FBI. There\u2019s the rub. There is a dark side to the federalists as well, agenda drive and very \u201canti-government,\u201d as much as any militia, in fact \u201cout neoconning\u201d the neocons hands down. \nThe Federalist Society is powerful, embedded everywhere and operating with a grand plan, one that involves something beyond tyranny as we know it, the full unabridged version of the corporate state where superior man is allowed his way and others, well, they learn to lie down and take it. \nThis is conservatism, or \u201cneo-conservatism\u201d as it exists, not on the news but in real life, elitism at the hands of self proclaimed elites \u201cin their own minds,\u201d empowered mama\u2019s boys, ass kissers and the kids that hung around the teacher\u2019s skirts during recess so they wouldn\u2019t get their tiny little asses handed to them by regular children. \nThe Plot \nWhat if congress were controlled by the Federalists? What if the Federalists controlled, until Scalia was killed anyway, the Supreme Court as well? What if the Federalists organized congress to block judicial appointments, in order to run the courts and control key cases around the country for paying clients, some drug cartels, defense companies but more often big polluters, drug companies and banks, the kind of banks that robo-sign mortgages and bilk customers out of their savings. \nThe Federalists run the FBI, having taken over after pushing aside the Mormon contingent, still alive and well but less powerful, that was put in place by Hoover. \nHere\u2019s the rub, we have seen congress do little during the Obama presidency but run investigations, some of them like Benghazi, built on \u201cfake news\u201d and internet conspiracies. We also mentioned that the FBI, rather than being a collection of elitist lawyers and big IQ guys, is now Fox News conspiracy junkies who, after 9/11, ate the entire donut cart of fantasy fed to the general public and have, for more than a decade, chased shadows and fought a war on terror against organization that never existed. \nWhere this applies now is in what we have seen over the past few days. We have established the \u201ccrying liberal goodguy\u201d credentials of James Comey, FBI Director. We know he hates torture, fought against, for awhile at least, the surveillance state and certainly convinced President Obama that he was going to be able to clean up the FBI after its long descent into disrepute during the Bush/Gonzales period. \nFor years, every time Alex Jones or some other podcaster or blogger, a \u201cfake news\u201d generator came up with a tale about Hillary Clinton, Congress put millions on the table and began the witch hunt. The version of Benghazi that congress chases around and the one the intelligence agencies know is real are so unrelated as to share almost no facts at all. Everything about Libya was secret, including the shotgun wedding between Gaddaffi and Bush/Blair, a sick threesome involving not just arms dealing but a covert nuclear weapons program, germ warfare labs and surrogate terrorism to be blamed on others, like Syria. \nWhere it gets dangerous is here, we have congress controlled by the GOP, a mix of Tea Party true believers, with the wild eyed look worn down a bit and the \u201cI am for sale, name a price\u201d written on their fat pink little pig faces. \nMix in the usual suspects, the \u201cWashington types,\u201d running when told, where told, fully at the services of the lobby, Israel, big Pharma, the drug cartels who top off their Bain Capital/Cayman Islands bank accounts\u2026 \nAdd to that, the endless obstructionism, the endless investigations and, wait for it, an FBI now controlled by the Federalist Society, the name group that runs the congressional investigations and manages the payoffs as well. \nThen Obama throws Comey into the mix. Here is what we are told; Comey killed the expected prosecution of Hillary not because the investigation showed she didn\u2019t commit crimes but because the investigation showed very much that she had committed many crimes, but for one minor problem. The investigation itself was corrupt, fabricating evidence, intimidating witnesses and falsifying everything it touched. The Federalists expected Comey to bend over as he had so many times in the past. Instead, he simply threw it all out. \nThe leaders of the FBI cabal met at a contractors ranch in Montana to discuss how to get not only Hillary but Comey as well. The deal was this, take a batch of emails that were \u201cout there,\u201d and there were hundreds of thousands unaccounted for. Seed classified information into them, for \u201csecurity\u2019s sake\u201d like had been done before, something Comey caught onto when he killed the FBI\u2019s case against Hillary. \nThen to do two things, crash the election and get rid of Comey. With Trump coming in, if things work out, Comey will be replaced with a puppet of choice and the Federalist run FBI will be unleashed to blackmail, torture and fabricate evidence until caught and there will be nobody left to speak up. \nWorking hand in hand with them will be congress and pouring money in, the drug cartels, the Israel/Saudi/Turkish lobby, big oil and maybe even the Russians as well, who knows. The sky is the limit. This is just like the good old days with Nixon. \nSetting up Comey was easy. Get the emails, put them on Weiner\u2019s computer and fail to legally gain access to them by not applying for a search warrant. Then go to Comey telling him they were just found. With his weak constitution and the abuse he got from Trump\u2019s people, combined with the \u201cline agent insurrection\u201d (yes, this is the term used) for standing up against them once, Comey would fold. \nComey folded, he took the bait and ran to congress with the weeks old illegally obtained probably seeded and falsified evidence that has burned down his career. \nWith calls for FBI Director James Comey to step down and accusations of FBI corruption from both the Trump and Clinton campaigns, sources have begun to come forward. What we are hearing, primarily from inside the FBI but from Washington insiders of both parties, will shake the very foundations of the republic. We begin: \nWhat We Know \nJames Comey has a history as a reformer and advocate of constitutional rights. In 2004, he was brought into the Bush Department of Justice but soon found much amiss and became a critic of torture, rendition and \u201ccooked\u201d terror cases. President Obama believed he was pulling a fast one by moving Comey, a Republican, into the slot as FBI director. Comey was tasked with reforming the Bureau, which had begun \u201ccowboying\u201d cases and making up the rules, widely abusing even its broadened powers under anti-terror legislation that many legal experts cite as being unconstitutional. To many in the FBI, the Patriot Acts and FISA weren\u2019t tyrannical enough. \nThe FBI is overrun with factions and some of them are closely tied to extremist groups that advocate the overthrow of the United States government. \nLet\u2019s be clear, most FBI agents are lawyers, many are experienced law enforcement officers and, typically, the majority are frighteningly honest, a bit dull and very right wing. Most FBI agents are \u201cbirthers,\u201d and still believe that President Obama is a Muslim and was born in Kenya, though there is no evidence, whatsoever, to imply that either assertion has merit. \nStill they believe this. In discussions with FBI agents and ranking FBI officials, invariably they are horribly uninformed on international affairs and seem as though they get their ideas about terror threats from TV shows. Most are not rooted in reality, not by standards of an intelligence agency or military command. The FBI has developed a closed culture, almost cult-like, where influences are often extremist, sometimes religious and were the organs of oversight and control have broken down. \nThe FBI can\u2019t be trusted. \nThe public knows that Director Comey wrote a letter to congress where he expressed an obligation to inform congress of evidence he had just received that indicated that not all emails between former Secretary of State Clinton and others, sent through a private server, had been evaluated for potential criminal elements. The letter went no further. \nComey had been warned not to send the letter, advised may be a better term, by Attorney General Loretta Lynch and other officials, making their case that he is not authorized to released such information and that the timing of this was highly suspect and this act would damage the reputation of the FBI. \nLynch was unaware that the emails had, in fact, been around for a up to a month. She was alway unaware that they had been illegally downloaded or \u201csynced\u201d into Anthony Weiner\u2019s computer. She was further unaware that existing search warrants made viewing or evaluating these emails, in any way, no matter how they had been accessed, was illegal. \nThus, when Comey commented in his letter about the basic nature of the emails, information only available through a process that violated law, he moved into the area of gross misconduct, perhaps criminal misconduct and left himself open for accusations of Hatch Act violation. The basis Comey applied for rationalizing his act was predicated on these points: A valid search warrant that covered these emails was in place. It was not. These emails had been, in fact, already in the hard drive and were not placed there, \u201cplanted\u201d or \u201csynced\u201d by the FBI. If Comey were told this or failed to ask or make certain, the standard for conspiracy and obstruction charges exist within his office and the case management team at the FBI. Comey based his letter on what he claimed was his belief that these emails had just been discovered. In fact they had been around for as long as five weeks, a fact that raises more questions: Why did Comey wait until just prior to an election? Who did he talk to? What transpired during this period? Why did Comey not as for a search warrant to review the emails, though we know the process, or at least a cursory and quite illegal process had already begun, until after he wrote his letter and was bombarded with criticism? \nA powerful group of FBI agents, opposed to Hillary Clinton, a group that includes extremists tied to the are the force behind the bizarre letter Director James Comey wrote to Congress last Friday, which have led to calls for his resignation and even arrest. \n\nThe FBI claims it knew of the Weiner/Abedin emails as early as September 22, 2016 and had certainly accessed them, without a warrant, by October 3 or 4. \nDirector Comey\u2019s letter to Congress makes reference to knowledge that could only be obtained by reviewing minimally header material but also limited text in the emails, which he makes note of, though there is no legal basis for him having any information at all, as no warrant was issued until yesterday. \nYesterday, Comey announced that the emails had been held for some time. If this is true, it was done without his knowledge, a serious breach of national security. If he did know, it is for Comey to show how he dealt with that knowledge for the past 30 days, with whom he conferred and why he waited. This is where Senator Reid finds basis for citing Comey as in criminal violation of the Hatch Act and sees likely intent on Comey\u2019s part to rig an election. \n\nThings in Washington are coming apart as a pattern of \u201ccowboying,\u201d up to and including criminal acts, planting evidence, Hatch Act violations, perjury and obstruction may well have infected the FBI. Sources indicate that \u201cline agents\u201d within the FBI who either support the Trump candidacy or strongly oppose Hillary Clinton, are using the Bureau to try to rig this year\u2019s presidential election, an assertion now echoing around Washington. \nThe Hillary email issues, cited by Senator Harry Reid (D) Utah as a violation of the Hatch Act, Federal employees involved in rigging an election, is only the tip of the iceberg. Yesterday, FBI Director James Comey admitted that he didn\u2019t know agents had withheld emails by Clinton aide, Huma Abedin, that he mistakenly reported to congress as a recent discovery. \nIn fact, not only had the agents held these emails for weeks, as early as September 22, 2016, they had failed to ask for a warrant to even view them. Moreover, the acquisition of the emails itself was, according to numerous sources, an abuse of a warrant. Worse still, as the emails weren\u2019t actually even on the computer but were loaded to it, and then misrepresented as being \u201cfound\u201d on the computer\u2019s hard drive. \nPractices like this were commonplace during the second Bush administration and it was James Comey that was brought in to institute reforms and end the procedural abuses that had become rampant inside the Bureau. After 9/11 sweeping changes in surveillance legislation and broadly expanded powers instilled in many agents, according to sources in the Department of Justice, a broad disrespect for constitutional guarantees. \n\u201cThey went a bit nuts there, and by the time Ashcroft (Attorney General) tried to rein them in, it was too late. Ashcroft was sick and was eventually pushed out by even stronger advocates of enhanced interrogation and the rule of the day, \u201crounding up the usual suspects,\u201d guilty or not, in order to make the papers and sell more terror legislation.\u201d",

        "body_en": "People over profits Dem Wingnut James Carville Melts Down, Says 'KGB' Controls FBI \nThe Democratic strategist calls reopened Clinton probe an 'attack' on American democracy in a MSNBC tantrum   PoliZette \nFamed Democratic strategist James Carville may be the first Clinton surrogate to have officially lost his mind over the FBI\u2019s decision to reopen its investigation into Clinton\u2019s private email server. \nIn an appearance on MSNBC on Monday, Carville relentlessly \u2014 and repeatedly \u2014 attacked the FBI\u2019s decision to reopen the investigation, asserting it is part of a conspiracy to subvert American democracy. \nApparently the fact that the Soviet security agency was disbanded in 1991 does not preclude its involvement in this vast, anti-Clinton, FBI-organized conspiracy, according to Carville. Poor Carville was clearly apoplectic at the news of Comey\u2019s announcement, describing it as an assault or attack on American democracy multiple times.\u201cThis is in effect an attempt to hijack an election,\u201d Carville claimed. \u201cIt\u2019s unprecedented \u2026 the House Republicans and the KGB are trying to influence our democracy,\u201d he said. \nHe was also adamant about who was responsible. \u201cComey was acting in concert and coordination with the House Republicans,\u201d Carville said. \u201cWe also have the extraordinary case of the KGB being involved in this race and selectively leaking things from the Clinton campaign that they hacked,\u201d he added. \nCarville was very upset that Comey's announcement thrust Clinton's behavior back into the spotlight. \"It would seem to me that the FBI shouldn't be getting rolled by the House Republicans, that's what happened here \u2014 there's nothing else that's going on \u2014 and in the meantime \u2026 democracy is under assault by the KGB,\" he said. \"To me that's something we ought to be talking about.\" \nUnfortunately for Carville, fanciful tales about time-traveling Soviet spies and an FBI in the GOP's pocket certainly make for interesting entertainment \u2014 but they pale in importance to the real-life stories of Clinton's brazen lawlessness. \nWhen the MSNBC anchor dared raise the fact that Democrats were praising Comey only a few months ago when he announced the FBI's decision not to recommend indictment, Carville went into a stuttering, sputtering fit. \n\"When the facts change I change my mind,\" Carville said. \"Why are you defending this, why are you sitting here as American democracy is under assault?\" he asked. \n\"This is an unprecedented event that was done on behalf of the House Republicans,\" Carville repeated. \"And as we know the KGB is all over this election and this is what we are talking about? We ought to be talking about [how] our democracy is under assault right now and what we are going to do about it, not [what somebody said in July] about James Comey.\"",

RELATED CONTENT WikiLeaks: New Evidence Shows DNC Forced Bernie Out \nHowever upon their arrival it became apparent that there was no imminent attack and the FBI agents were only there to secretly gather intelligence on WikiLeaks and Julian Assange. \u201cEight or nine\u201d FBI agents were then ordered to leave the country. \nWikiLeaks has many members in Iceland, a nation of activists that has swept the anti-establishment Pirate Party to the verge of forming government with similar non-mainstream parties this weekend. \nBirgitta Jonsdottir, the Pirate\u2019s nominal leader, is a former WikiLeaks member who worked with Assange on the release of Collateral Murder in 2010. \nThe FBI has form when it comes to investigating WikiLeaks via Iceland. In December 2010, the US attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia requested Twitter account information for Jonsdottir. The subpoena cited a specific conspiracy provision that may have been aimed at those thought to have assisted Private Manning. Birgitta J\u00f3nsd\u00f3ttir, Member of Parliament and former WikiLeaks associate. \nHerbert Snorrason, a former WikiLeaks member once close to Assange, wrote on his website that he had been provided orders, unsealed on May 2, including a search warrant served on Google for \u201c all e-mail associated with my GMail account, every shred of information they had on my identity, and anything I\u2019d uploaded to a Google service .\u201d \nSnorrason says the reason for the search warrant was \u201c because I had a conversation or a few with a white-haired Australian guy . These kinds of orders have been served on more of the people I know than I really care to think about. \u201c \nAnother young activist, Sigurdur Ingi Thordarson, told a closed session of Iceland\u2019s Parliament in 2013 that he had been cooperating with United States agents investigating WikiLeaks. Sigurdur Ingi Thordarson (known as Siggi) with Julian Assange in London. \n\u201c He was at the time going back and forwards going to meet Julian. They were trying to get him to go there wearing a wire ,\u201d Jonsdottir said in an interview. \nOrdering the FBI agents to leave proves the self-sufficient island nation does more than pay lip service to ideals of transparency and freedom. It is also a powerful display of sovereignty that suggests they will be true to their word regarding plans to grant citizenship to Edward Snowden. \nWhen asked by reporters if they are worried that granting a haven to the NSA whistleblower might rile their NATO ally, the United States, Jonsdottir said, \u201c Well, we have done things that don\u2019t make other nations happy before. Sometimes it\u2019s a case of doing what is right versus what is easy. \u201d",

        "body_en": "BREAKING: Racketeering indictment of Hillary Clinton now \u2018likely\u2019 as FOIA for Datto backup device reveals FBI possesses ALL the incriminating emails \n\nMike Adams The Health Ranger \n\nNaturalNews) Natural News can now reveal that dozens of democrat operatives will be facing criminal indictment from damning email evidence that has been in the possession of the FBI for more than a year. The bad news is that such indictments may take months to formally announce, with criminal proceedings requiring years to reach a conclusion. The good news is that Hillary Clinton isn\u2019t going to get away with her criminal racketeering for much longer, as the U.S. intelligence community is now determined to make sure she faces justice regardless of the outcome of next Tuesday\u2019s election. \nHere\u2019s the evidence that supports these assertions: \nFirst, FBI sources have told Fox News\u2019 Bret Baier that an indictment is \u201clikely.\u201d From Real Clear Politics : \nSources within the FBI have told him that an indictment is \u201clikely\u201d in the case of pay-for-play at the Clinton Foundation, \u201cbarring some obstruction in some way\u201d from the Justice Department. No doubt Loretta Lynch is determined to engage in that obstruction in one form or another, which is probably why Lynch herself may be among those who are eventually indicted for criminal conspiracy . \nSecond, this Oct. 28 announcement from Dr. Larry Kawa, working in partnership with Judicial Watch , reveals an astonishing discovery: That all of Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails were backed up to a \u201cDatto device\u201d long before she started deleting emails (i.e. destroying evidence). \nFrom the announcement: \nCitizen Activist Dr. Larry Kawa of Boca Raton, Florida today announced that he has expanded the scope of his efforts to bring former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u2019s hidden electronic communications to light. He is now calling for full disclosure of a hard drive that was turned over by Datto Inc. to the FBI as of 2015. According to CNN, the contents of the Datto hard drive are believed to contain all of Hillary Clinton\u2019s backed up electronic communications from her time as Secretary of State. The \u201cDatto device\u201d backups are now in the hands of the FBI \nIt turns out that Datto, Inc. is a data backup company which had real-time access to Hillary Clinton\u2019s private email server for the purpose of backing up her emails. That backup data set was turned over to the FBI in 2015, but the FBI likely did not realize what they were holding at the time. \nIt wasn\u2019t until the Clinton Foundation email scandal began to unfold that FBI agents realized what they possessed. Now, it turns out the FBI has been sorting through those emails (and other evidence) for more than a year. \nIn addition \u2014 and this is a real shocker for those who have been following this \u2014 the FBI did not destroy the laptops from Clinton\u2019s co-conspirators. \nVia Real Clear Politics: \nThe Clinton Foundation investigation is far more expansive than anybody has reported so far and has been going on for more than a year. The laptops of Clinton aides Cherryl Mills and Heather Samuelson have not been destroyed, and agents are currently combing through them. Now the FBI has at least FOUR sources of damning emails with overwhelming criminal evidence of Hillary Clinton\u2019s racketeering enterprise \nWhat all this means now is that the FBI has four sources of emails that Hillary Clinton and her close associates attempted to destroy: \nSource #1) Anthony Weiner\u2019s laptop , which somehow seems to have held 650,000 of Huma Abedin\u2019s emails, if reports are true, in addition to whatever child sexting pervert pics Weiner himself had collected (yeah, he\u2019s a democrat). \nSource #2) The non-destroyed laptops of Cherryl Mills and Heather Samuelson , which the media incorrectly reported had been destroyed as part of the FBI\u2019s investigation \u201cconclusion\u201d earlier this year. \nSource #3) The Datto, Inc. backup device which has already been turned over the FBI and likely contains all of Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails that she attempted to destroy (via Bleach Bit). \nSource #4) Wikileaks dumps of John Podesta emails which keep getting posted in large batches like clockwork, day after day, revealing astonishing layers of corruption and collusion among dozens of key players conspiring with the Clintons. From these four sources of emails, an undeniable pattern of criminal racketeering emerges \nAll this evidence isn\u2019t just going to incriminate Hillary Clinton, by the way: This vast conspiracy of criminal collusion, corruption, pay-to-pay bribery and racketeering will ensnare dozens \u2014 if not hundreds \u2014 of DNC operatives and Clinton Foundation cohorts. (Can we please release some non-violent drug offenders from the prisons to make room for the Clinton brigade?) \nIn case you didn\u2019t already realize this, we\u2019re now watching the uncovering of a massive criminal conspiracy involving hundreds of willing participants, spanning the DNC, the Dept. of Justice, the White House, the Clinton Foundation and of course the State Department. When it\u2019s all said and done, this will be the largest criminal conspiracy ever uncovered in the history of the United States of America . And it was all masterminded by a woman who claims that her vagina gives her some sort of special privilege to ascend to power in America. \nThe only downside to all this is that it might take years to fully prosecute the criminal cases against these Clinton criminals, and no doubt many of those who are guilty of committing these crimes will go free in exchange for testifying against their racketeering bosses. But the Clinton house of cards is now destined to fall, eventually ending one of the most shocking and dark chapters of American history and government corruption. Hillary Clinton\u2019s private email server was hacked by FIVE foreign intelligence agencies, says FBI source \nBeyond everything mentioned above, Hillary Clinton\u2019s illegal private email server has long since been compromised by multiple foreign intelligence agencies, allowing any of them to easily BLACKMAIL Clinton if she were to become President . \nVia Real Clear Politics : \nFBI sources say with 99% accuracy that Hillary Clinton\u2019s server has been hacked by at least five foreign intelligence agencies, and that information had been taken from it. \nThis means that from the very first moment Hillary Clinton might seize power in Washington D.C., she would be at the mercy of Chinese, Russian, North Korean or possibly even Iranian political leaders who would issue blackmail threats against her unless she granted them requested political favors. \nNotably, the entire leftist media is communicating absolutely none of this to its readers and viewers, counting on the true fact that most Clinton supporters are too stupid or too self-deluded to understand the high stakes game of international geopolitics. As a result, people who continue to say they support Hillary Clinton are, astonishingly, helping elect a criminal kingpin into the highest office the land\u2026 even as she has already been deeply compromised by foreign enemies that seek the outright destruction of the United States. \nThis is likely why the U.S. intelligence services \u2014 part of the \u201cdeep state\u201d apparatus \u2014 has now turned against Hillary Clinton and has made a decision to take her down . What every informed person now realizes \u2014 both in government and outside it \u2014 is that Hillary Clinton poses a clear and present danger to the national security of the United States of America , and that allowing her to seize power in Washington would spell outright doom for the nation and its people. Why the Huffington Post is also a danger to America \nRemember this as you browse the internet: Every website that\u2019s trying to get Clinton elected, including the Huffington Post, is working to place a seditious racketeering criminal into the highest office of the land. Such malicious acts are, in their own right, serious crimes against America, yet they characterize the entire delusional left-wing media and blogosphere, widely populated by academics who are so ignorant about the real world that they are incapable of recognizing the rise of a fascist, totalitarian regime even as it emerges in front of their very eyes. \nUniversities no longer teach students anything about the real world, you see, so a person can emerge from a top-tier university with a PhD while being so ignorant and deluded about reality that they would gladly vote for another Adolf Hitler if he dressed up in rainbow colors, chanted \u201clove wins\u201d and claimed to be transgender. (Bonus question: Could a biological man with a penis claim to self-identify as a woman and run for office under the premise of being the first \u201cwoman\u201d president? Cognitively obedient liberals \u2014 who are all completely insane morons \u2014 would no doubt vote for the \u201cwoman,\u201d achieving the incredible distinction of placing the first female into the White House who also had a scrotum and could pee standing up. Liberal historians take note\u2026 this is somehow called \u201cequality\u2026\u201d) \nEvery website rooting for Hillary Clinton is blindly pursuing the total damnation of America , all under the guise of \u201csocial justice\u201d or the silly pursuit of the \u201cfirst female President\u201d as if possessing a vagina is some sort of magical qualification for political superiority. \nImagine their mutual surprise when they soon discover that a vagina-possessing liberal politician turned out to be the most corrupt, dishonest and dangerous presidential candidate in history\u2026 a woman who created a massive criminal cartel and collected hundreds of millions of dollars in illegal profits while selling government influence to the highest international bidders. No penis required. So much for the glass ceiling theory, eh? \nIn summary, Hillary Clinton is a woman who once held the world by the balls\u2026 but then had to let go when the stank of her own putrid crimes was too much to stomach any longer. In the end, she will be remembered as nothing more than a crotchety old hag with a reptilian appetite for power and a sickening disregard for humankind. Prepare your in-flight vomit bags, folks, because this final approach to election day is going to involve nauseating turbulence and more than a few stomach-churning freefalls.",
