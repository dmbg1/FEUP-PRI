        "body_en": "BREAKING: Since Donald Trump Won The Presidency Ford Shifts Truck Production From Mexico To Ohio 3 Shares Comments \nFord\u2019s heavy duty pickup trucks which used to be built in Mexico started rolling off an assembly line in Ohio this week. \nThat\u2019s good news for the 1,000 Ford workers in Ohio, who might have otherwise been out of work. \nIt\u2019s also good publicity for Ford ( F ), which has been under fire for investing so much in Mexico. In April, the automaker said it would invest $2.5 billion in transmission plants in the Mexican states of Chihuahua and Guanajuato, creating about 3,800 jobs there. \nFord\u2019s south-of-the-border strategy has drawn heavy criticism from groups such as the United Auto Workers union and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. \nThe Avon Lake, Ohio, plant produced its first batch of Ford\u2019s full-size F-650 and F-750 pick up trucks on Wednesday. \n\u201cOur investment\u2026reinforces our commitment to building vehicles in America,\u201d said Joe Hinrichs, Ford president, The Americas. \u201cWorking with our partners in the UAW, we found a way to make the costs competitive enough to bring production of a whole new generation of work trucks to Ohio.\u201d \nThe move comes at a delicate time for Ford. \nThe United Auto Workers union is in negotiations with the automaker as well as General Motors ( GM ) and Fiat Chrysler ( FCAM ) on new labor deals to replace those that expire next month. And promises by the automakers to keep production and jobs at U.S. plants is a major focus of the union. \nThe union is particularly worried about the plan Ford announced in July to shift production of the C-Max and Focus out of a Wayne, Mich., plant in 2018. The automaker hasn\u2019t said where that work will go, but employees fear those cars will be built in Mexico. It\u2019s also not clear whether any other cars will be made at the Wayne plant instead, in order to protect about 4,000 jobs. \n\u201cWe\u2019re actively pursuing other alternatives for the Wayne plant that will be discussed with our UAW friends. We haven\u2019t decided what will go there,\u201d said Ford spokeswoman Kristina Adamski. \nRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump recently said that if he\u2019s elected he would take steps to make it more expensive for manufacturers to shift work to Mexico and then export the items back to the United States. \n\u201cHow does that help us?\u201d Trump said about the Ford investment in Mexico while campaigning in Michigan this week. \u201cMexico is becoming the new China.\u201d",

        "body_en": "Comments \n(New York Times Results by County) \nThe media won\u2019t tell you this but Donald Trump CRUSHED Hillary Clinton in the recent election in three key areas: \nFor one, the above results by county show that he picked up a significant amount of the counties in the US. The picture is clear that most counties in America voted for Trump . \nSecondly, the media is also hiding from you that Trump CRUSHED Hillary in the Electoral College (EC). As of today, most if not all media outlets show that Trump won the election with only 279 EC votes. But the truth is Trump also won Michigan with 16 EC votes and Arizona with 11 EC votes for a total of 306 EC votes. Hillary only won 228 EC votes but it looks like she barely won New Hampshire which should put her at 232 EC votes. As a result, Trump won 57% of all EC votes. \nHIllary turned in the Democratic Party\u2019s worst Electoral College performance in 28 years. With only New Hampshire left to be called, Clinton has turned in the Democratic Party\u2019s worst Electoral College performance in 28 years pic.twitter.com/APU85Ty50q \n\u2014 Dan O\u2019Donnell (@DanODradio) November 9, 2016 \nThirdly, in total states it was a landslide. Trump won 31 states to 19 states won by Hillary or 62% of the states. \nThe mainstream will argue that Hillary beat Trump in the popular vote which appears accurate. According to the NYT she won 59,923,027 to Trump\u2019s 59,692,974 for a difference of only 230,053 or 0.4%. But in California and New York Hillary beat Trump by a combined 4 million votes. If not for these two huge liberal states, Hillary would have gotten shellacked in the popular voting as well. \nThe mainstream media will not tell you but Trump won BIGLY!",

The Gateway Pundit reported that Malik posted a video of himself wearing a Trump hat on Twitter to prove that his account is real. Watch as Malik tells his followers to \u201cvote Trump,\u201d something we never thought we\u2019d hear an Obama say! \n\u2014 MicroSpookyLeaks\u2122 (@WDFx2EU7) October 27, 2016 Trump made headlines a few weeks ago when he invited Malik to the second presidential debate as his guest. Western Journalism reported that Malik has been an outspoken Trump supporter throughout this election. \u201cI like Donald Trump because he speaks from the heart,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2018Make America Great Again\u2019 is a great slogan. I would like to meet him.\u201d As for Trump, he\u2019s very excited to meet Malik as well. \u201cI look very much forward to meeting and being with Malik,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe gets it far better than his brother.\u201d Malik was once a Democrat, but he\u2019s said that foreign policy missteps and social concerns have caused him to move to the Republican side. He has also said he distrusts Hillary Clinton, citing her scandals and dishonesty, which he says have only gotten worse since he originally voiced his support for Trump. \u201cI don\u2019t like [Hillary] Clinton,\u201d Malik said in September, in spite of his half-brother\u2019s proud endorsement. \u201cShe is dishonest and a liar. She keeps on lying about emails every time.\u201d Malik has slammed Clinton\u2019s performance as Secretary of State, pointing out that she inflamed chaos and violence in the Middle East.

After the show, I want you to know that I will go straight to a rehab facility.\u201d \nThe comedian added that she looks forward to \u201cputting this all behind us\u201d in November, when \u201c Hillary Clinton is our motherf*cking president.\u201d \nMadonna has previously used sex appeal to drum up support for the Democratic presidential candidate; in September, the singer joined fellow pop star Katy Perry in stripping off her clothes to encourage Clinton voters to head to the polls in November.",
