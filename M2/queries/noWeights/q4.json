The HRC has endorsed Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election.\nTheir new video advertisement features Clinton\u2019s pledge to fight for the LGBT community\u2019s equality. The ad was also released days before the election on Nov. 8.\nThe video titled \u201cHillary Clinton: Equality Is About Changing Hearts And Minds,\u201d was released in Washington D.C., which is the HRC headquarters are located.\nThe organization has a section of their website dedicated to the group\u2019s endorsement of the candidate. The HRC also stated that Clinton has stood with the LGBTQ community and the group will now stand with Clinton. The HRC concluded by saying that Clinton\u2019s fight is with the community and that what the HRC advocates.\nThe HRC President Chad Griffin said that Clinton has shown through her words and actions that she is dedicated to fighting for the rights of the LGBT community. He also stated that all of the progress the community has made is at stake in the 2016 Presidential election as the HRC has endorsed a candidate in the 2016 election.\nGriffin then continued to state that Donald Trump\u2019s campaign is filled with hateful language that will reverse the LGBTQ movement\u2019s gains. He also said that Clinton will tear down the walls of bigotry against people of alternative lifestyles. The HRC leader concluded by saying that it is very important that people who are pro-equality voters for Clinton in the next presidential election.\nBreitbart stated that an artist from the Art Wing Conspiracy group said a lot of Trump supporters, especially amongst the LGBT community, are \u201cin the closet.\u201d The artistic group has painted several Think Different posters across the city of San Francisco near the offices of Twitter and Clinton\u2019s campaign headquarters. The posters feature a rainbow Apple logo with a silhouette of Trump\u2019s face on it. They were released on National Coming Out Day.\nThe Art Wing Conspiracy artist also stated that on National Coming Out Day the organization encourages people to \u201cstop living a lie and come out.\u201d He conveyed this idea, in a voting booth, i.e. a closet, no one has to know who supports Trump or Clinton.\nThe artist also said that the liberal community in San Francisco must know that there are many Trump supporters amongst the city\u2019s LGBT community. The individual stated that having pride means to be true to oneself and one\u2019s beliefs, even if it is against the mainstream. The artist concluded that is what the LGBT rights movement conveys.\nThe Stonewall Inn\u2019s website stated that the historic inn was the birthplace of the historic LGBT rights movement. The patrons of the club retaliated against harassment from the local police department. Subsequently, a riot occurred on June 28, 1969.\nThe website also claimed that the patrons refused to accept the status quo of oppression for the first time. They then stood up for each other and the whole LGBT community.\nThe site continues to state that the riot at the Stonewall Inn sparked the lengthy battle for all members of the Gay and Lesbian community. The incident is often referred to as the Rosa Parks incident of the LGBT community. The site then stated that the incident led the government and society, in general, to look at members of the LBGT community as equals.\nIn 1969 the police raided gay clubs regularly. Eight police officers arrived at the Stonewall Inn on a Saturday morning at 1:20. Approximately 200 people were in the establishment that night. However, the raid was not conducted as planned. The patrons did not cooperate, resulting in the riot that led to the LGBT rights movement of the 1970s, which is why the HRC now exists and has endorsed a candidate for the 2016 election.\nBy John A.

        "body_en": "US Presidential Elections Sound a Warning of Catastrophes to Come By Daily Bell Staff - November 08, 2016 \nWhat\u2019s wrong with Hillary Clinton\u2019s brand? \u2026 As momentous an occasion as this should be for women around the world, Ms. Clinton would begin her term in the Oval Office with her unpopularity ratings at near-record levels. All of which leads to the question: What\u2019s wrong with Brand Hillary? \u2013 The Globe and Mail \nIn the run-up to today\u2019s election, many articles on Hillary in the mainstream media have tried to explain more fully why Hillary is electable and desirable as the leader of the US. \nA common theme of these articles is that Hillary\u2019s troubles are not mentioned or analyzed in detail. The Economist magazine, like many other publications, recently came out with an endorsement of Hillary. \nBut the endorsement simply dealt with Hillary\u2019s legislative and professional history. As always when it comes to Hillary in the mainstream media, deeper questions are glossed over. \nThis approach to covering Hillary is deliberate and has generated increasing skepticism among large portions of the American public. Correctly, alternative media reports have pointed out this declining credibility but not enough have explained its widening ramifications. \nMore: \nMs. Clinton is one of the most qualified presidential candidates in recent memory \u2013 and her credentials are that much more impressive compared to those of her opponent. \nAfter her time as first lady \u2013 in the state of Arkansas, and in the White House \u2013 Ms. Clinton served her country as a U.S. Senator and as secretary of state. \nThe article goes on to ask why Hillary has not been \u201cable to break through in a way that inspires fervent support and popularity.\u201d \nAt this point a significant analysis would grapple with underlying issues regarding Hillary\u2019s background and approach to politics and life. These issues are well known. But instead, these issues are presented as \u201cmultiple scandals, ranging from Lewinsky to Benghazi, and most recently, her e-mails.\u201d \nThe use of the word \u201cscandal\u201d implies something embarrassing. The significance of these problems in her personal and professional life goes far beyond embarrassment. It illustrates her approach to the US political system and generally how she wields power. \nHaving skipped past this analysis, the article then minimizes the scandals themselves, stating, \u201dAny politician who has been in the game that long has their fair share of scandal.\u201d \nThe article continues to evolve toward ephemera, suggesting that a big problem with Ms. Clinton is her inability to \u201cappear likable to voters.\u201d This is a political problem to be sure, but it is not the UNDERLYING problem, which is much more significant. \nFinally, the article brings up the idea that a big reason for the disconnect between Hillary and voters has to do with her gender. \u201cAs disheartening as that still is, society and the media still stereotype women and paint them with a negative brush.\u201d \nThe article explains that much criticism of Hillary is gender-related. She has been scrutinized because of her health problems and has too-often been seen by the media as a wife and mother rather than as a businesslike politician with a long, professional history. \nAs stated, articles like this are at variance with what many believe to be true. Hillary is seen, at this point, by tens of millions as a person with an extremely shady past who may be part of a larger political mafia with her husband that deals in extortion, cover-ups, drug-dealing and even murder to generate vast profits for their Clinton Foundation, and thus for themselves. \nSince this information is so widely dispersed, articles that don\u2019t deal more directly with these issues can be seen either as painfully naive or as concealing something. It is one of the reasons that trust in the mainstream media has plunged so precipitously. \nAdditionally, as we pointed out recently, belief in \u201cconspiracy theories,\u201d has risen to over 50 percent. Hillary\u2019s campaign and its coverage may be directly responsible. Once people were increasingly and regularly exposed to the disconnect between what they believed about Hillary and what was being presented, they began to reexamine various \u201cconspiracy\u201d reports they\u2019d previously discounted. \nEven among those voting for Hillary, there is widespread sentiment that she may have committed criminal wrongdoings and deserves a trial rather than the presidency. \nWe\u2019ve advanced the idea that none of this has come about by accident, not the FBI fumblings, nor reports of her healthcare problems, nor even the email \u201cscandals.\u201d All of this in fact was known well in advance of her latest presidential run. \nThis is simply not a coincidence in our view. The idea, increasingly it seems, is to shatter cultural cohesion in the West with an eye toward creating increased globalization and an internationalized society. This presidential election and its mainstream coverage has done just that. \nGoing forward, it is probable that cultural destruction will be increasingly significant throughout the West, employing numerous strategies \u2013 political, ethnic, economic and military. \nThese elections \u2013 whether Hillary wins or Trump \u2013 are evidently the starting gun, along with the European immigrant crisis, for a new series of elite programs. These will likely yield up serial catastrophes that will change lives and belief structures going forward for millions and even billions \nConclusion: Building an international world, whether the effort is to be successful or not, is a massive and horribly disruptive and bloody prospect. Americans would be wise to perceive this latest presidential elections as a kind of warning of what it is to come.",

        "body_en": "U.S. militia girds for trouble as presidential election nears 11/02/2016 \nREUTERS \nDown a Georgia country road, camouflaged members of the Three Percent Security Force have mobilized for rifle practice, hand-to-hand combat training \u2014 and an impromptu campaign rally for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. \n\u201cHow many people are voting for Trump? Ooh-rah!\u201d asks Chris Hill, a paralegal who goes by the code name \u201cBloodagent.\u201d \n\u201cOoh-rah!\u201d shout a dozen militia members in response, as morning sunlight sifted through the trees last weekend. \nAs the most divisive presidential election in recent memory nears its conclusion, some armed militia groups are preparing for the possibility of a stolen election on Nov. 8 and civil unrest in the days following a victory by Democrat Hillary Clinton. \nThey say they won\u2019t fire the first shot, but they\u2019re not planning to leave their guns at home, either. \nTrump\u2019s populist campaign has energized militia members like Hill, who admire the Republican mogul\u2019s promise to deport illegal immigrants, stop Muslims from entering the country and build a wall along the Mexico border. Trump has repeatedly warned that the election may be \u201crigged,\u201d and has said he may not respect the results if he does not win. At least one paramilitary group, the Oath Keepers, has called on members to monitor voting sites for signs of fraud. \nArmed paramilitary groups first gained prominence in the early 1990s, fueled by confrontations in Ruby Ridge, Idaho and Waco, Texas, culminating in a militia sympathizer\u2019s 1995 bombing of a federal office building in Oklahoma City that killed 168 people. \nTheir numbers dwindled following that attack but have spiked in recent years, driven by fears that President Barack Obama will threaten gun ownership and erode the power of local government. The Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks extremist groups, estimates there were 276 active militias last year, up from 42 in 2008. \nIn recent years, armed groups have confronted federal authorities in a series of land-use disputes in the western United States. Federal officials fear more clashes could come after seven militants were acquitted on conspiracy charges for occupying a federal wildlife refuge in Oregon. \nMany fear Clinton would push the county further to the left. \n\u201cThis is the last chance to save America from ruin,\u201d Hill said. \u201cI\u2019m surprised I was able to survive or suffer through eight years of Obama without literally going insane, but Hillary is going to be more of the same.\u201d \n\nEXTREMIST GROUPS EMBOLDENED \nThe Oath Keepers, a prominent anti-government force that sent gun-toting members to the 2014 race riots in Ferguson, Missouri, called on members last week to monitor voting sites on election day for any signs of fraud. \nAn hour south of Atlanta, the Three Percent Security Force started the day around the campfire, taking turns shooting automatic pistols and rifles at a makeshift target range. They whooped with approval when blasts from one member\u2019s high-powered rifle knocked down a tree. \nThe group operates independently, but is affiliated with a national armed movement that calls for members to defend individual rights in the face of what they see as an overreaching federal government. The movement draws its name from the notion that no more than 3 percent of the American population fought in the Revolutionary War against Britain. \nAmid the war games, Hill weighed plans for a possible armed march on Washington if Clinton wins. \nHe said he doesn\u2019t want his members leading the way, but they will defend the protesters if need be. His group will not hesitate to act if a President Clinton tries to disarm gun owners, he said. \n\u201cI will be there to render assistance to my fellow countrymen, and prevent them from being disarmed, and I will fight and I will kill and I may die in the process,\u201d said Hill, who founded the militia several years ago. \nTrump\u2019s candidacy has emboldened extremist groups to speak more openly about challenging the rule of law, said Ryan Lenz, a researcher at the Southern Poverty Law Center. \n\u201cPrior to this campaign season, these ideas were relegated to sort of the political fringe of the American political landscape,\u201d he said. \u201cNow these ideas are legitimized.\u201d \nOver the past week, some prominent Trump supporters have hinted at violence. \n\u201cIf Trump loses, I\u2019m grabbing my musket,\u201d former Illinois Representative Joe Walsh wrote on Twitter last week. Conservative commentator Wayne Root fantasized about Clinton\u2019s death while speaking at a Trump rally in Las Vegas on Sunday. \nBack in Georgia, the Three Percent Security Force wrapped up rifle practice in the midday sun. They then headed further into the trees to tackle an obstacle course with loaded pistols at their sides, ready for whatever may come. \n\u201cWe\u2019ve building up for this, just like the Marines,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are going to really train harder and try to increase our operational capabilities in the event that this is the day that we hoped would never come.\u201d Share On:",

        "body_en": "November 14, 2016 - Fort Russ News - \n\nFabrizio Poggi, in  Contropiano , translated from Italian by Tom Winter \n\nIgor Dodon, President-elect of Moldova \nMoldova and Bulgaria: Something new in the East \nRumen Radev, President-elect of Bulgaria \nIn the east - not everywhere, sadly - there is a turn towards Moscow. The newly elected presidents of Moldavia and Bulgaria seem to want to go in that direction. \n\nIn Kishinev, where two weeks ago, no candidate had a majority in round one, the Socialist Party leader, Igor Dodon, has 52.6% of the votes (not including expatriate votes from US and Canada, but these can not overturn the result) against the pro-EU Maia Sandu, leader of the Action and Solidarity Party, with 47.3% and who, in Yankee fashion, is now threatening \"mass demonstrations,\" not recognizing the result. \nMaia Sandu  Dodon congratulated Sandu for the \"honorable result\" and invited her to discussions, without destabilizing the country. It seems (though not official at this time of writing) that the turnout was respectable; this was the first direct election of the president of the republic since 1996; since 2000 in fact, the President was elected by Parliament. There was even shortage of ballots, in particular in various stations abroad: Bologna, Parma, Paris, Moscow, Bucharest; Portugal appears to have lost the entire st of ballots. \n\nOn the eve of the vote Dodon, an experienced office-holder, (Deputy Prime Minister in 2008-2009 and Minister of Economy in 2006-2009) said that if he won, his first visit abroad would would be to Moscow, \"to start working out a strategic partnership agreement\" and to renew exports to Russia, which were limited after the signing of the association and free trade agreement with the EU.  \n\nDodon has always said he was \"confident of victory. People are tired of the seven years of EU coalition, poverty, corruption, lawlessness, and want to live in a state of their own and not in some province of another country.\"  \n\nThe socialist leader has also called for the Russian peacekeepers to remain in Transnistria, until the complete solution of the political events through the federalization of Moldova, which Sandu opposes. According to Tass, all candidates had based their election campaign primarily on foreign issues: pointing on one side to the \"hand of the Kremlin,\" and, on the other to \"Washington's Regional Committee,\"  a side which was still floating a union with Romania. The Socialists pointed to Maia Sandu as \"a puppet of the US\" - where she studied and worked at the World Bank, and tied her to Angela Merkel, Donald Tusk, and Jean-Claude Juncker, apparently even to former Romanian President, Traian B\u0103sescu, who got himself awarded Moldovan citizenship [! -tr] in order to vote for Maia Sandu.  \n\nOn the other side Sandu was proposing, along with strategic partnership with Washington, close contacts with Kiev, even a future union with Romania. \n\nAs expected, there are the threats of yet another \"Orange Revolution,\" like the one in 2009 after the Communist Party won the election in Moldova, under the flags of EU and Romania, with rioting which brought broken windows and arson to the Parliament and the presidential residence.  \n\nObviously, Brussels was on the \"orange\" side: the results of seven years of EU-line coalition are also seen in the demonstrations a year ago against the oligarchy in power, in the rejection of government policy on the part of 80% of the population, and in those favoring integration with Brussels falling from 70% to 37%.  \n\nIn addition, the Donald Trump victory seems to have played a role also in Kishinev: \"The geopolitical color of the Moldovan leadership will become less important for the United States,\" Andrei Popov said in a NewsMaker interview. Popov, former Deputy Foreign Minister of Moldova, added that Washington will renounce a whole series of Moldovan projects that were initiated by the Clinton circle. \n\nAlso, in Bulgaria, the coalition headed by the Socialist Party prevailed in the second presidential round of the general election: Air Force General Rumen Radev topped his opponent Tsetska Tsa\u010deva by 4-5% (the result is not final). Tsa\u010deva was the candidate of the pro-government coalition GERB (\"Citizens for European development of Bulgaria).\"  \n\nIn the first round, Sunday, Nov. 6, no candidate reached the 30% necessary for the election: Radev was at 25.4% and Tsa\u010deva at 21.9%.  \n\nThe now president-elect said he was opposed to Bulgaria's permanence in NATO (of which the country has been a member since 2004) and in the EU, and has spoken out for closer relations with Russia.  \n\nThe Prime Minister, the hawk Boyko Borissov had promised to resign if Radev won, while he was still hoping for a Tsa\u010deva victory, seems to have kept his word, opening a crisis that does not seem easy to solve. \n\nIn opposition to the overtly anti-Russian, phil-atlantic policies of former President Rosen Plevneliev and Boyko Borissov, Radev said that \"deepening the dialogue with Russia will reduce confrontation and tension, and hopefully lead to the normalization of the situation in Syria and Ukraine.\"  \n\nWith regard to the anti-Russian sanctions, he stressed that this \"is a matter of the government's responsibility. But, as President, I am committed to dialogue, to seek a solution with EU colleagues.\" As for internal affairs, he said \"despite threats of the apocalypse,\" the voters \"voted for change and democracy, overcoming apathy and fear.\" \n\nAn entity that in contrast does not change policy towards Russia is the European Union.  Federica Mogherini,  EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs, said that Brussels does not intend to change its own position on Russia, even if the White House, after the arrival of Donald Trump, pursues a rapprochement with the Kremlin.  \n\nThe EU, as Mogherini spelled it out, \"has a principled stand on the issue of the annexation of the Crimea and on the situation in Ukraine, and will not change it, regardless of any changes of position by other countries, including the United States.  \n\n\"Ipse dixit et salvavit eos**; of course, the \"Russian aggression! \n\n\n* A view from the Italian Communist Party on-line journal; for the take of Eduard Popov on these two election victories, click. \n\n** \"She herself has said it, and saved them\" [Correcting to \"ipsa\"] -- an apparent reference to the Catholic confessional \"dixi et salvavi animam\" -- I have spoken and saved my soul.\"\n\n     Follow us on Facebook!                                                   \n                                                   \n\n       Follow us on Twitter! \n                               \n\n             Donate!",

        "body_en": "Can The Oligarchy Still Steal The Presidential Election?\nPaul Craig Roberts\nThe election was set up to be stolen from Trump. That was the purpose of the polls rigged by overweighting Hillary supporters in the samples. After weeks of hearing poll results that Hillary was in the lead, the public would discount a theft claim. Electronic voting makes elections easy to steal, and I have posted explanations by election fraud experts of how it is done.\nClearly the Oligarchy does not want Donald Trump in the White House as they are unsure that they could control him, and Hillary is their agent. \nWith the reopening of the FBI investigation of Hillary and related scandals exploding all around her, election theft is not only more risky but also less likely to serve the Oligarchy\u2019s own interests.\nImage as well as money is part of Oligarchic power. The image of America takes a big hit if the American people elect a president who is currently under felony investigation. \nMoreover, a President Hillary would be under investigation for years. With so much spotlight on her, she would not be able to serve the Oligarchy\u2019s interests. She would be worthless to them, and, indeed, investigations that unearthed various connections between Hillary and oligarchs could damage the oligarchs. \nIn other words, for the Oligarchy Hillary has moved from an asset to a liability.\nA Hillary presidency could put our country into chaos. I doubt the oligarchs are sufficiently stupid to think that once she is sworn in, Hillary can fire FBI Director Comey and shut down the investigation. The last president that tried that was Richard Nixon, and look where that got him. \nMoreover, the Republicans in the House and Senate would not stand for it. House Committee on oversight and Government Reform chairman Jason Chaffetz has already declared Hillary to be \u201ca target-rich environment. Even before we get to day one, we\u2019ve got two years worth of material already lined up.\u201d House Speaker Paul Ryan said investigation will follow the evidence.\nIf you were an oligarch, would you want your agent under this kind of scrutiny? If you were Hillary, would you want to be under this kind of pressure? \nWhat happens if the FBI recommends the indictment of the president? Even insouciant Americans would see the cover-up if the attorney general refused to prosecute the case. Americans would lose all confidence in the government. Chaos would rule. Chaos can be revolutionary, and that is not good for oligarchs.\nMoreover, if reports can be believed, salacious scandals appear to be waiting their time on stage. For example, last May Fox News reported: \n\u201cFormer President Bill Clinton was a much more frequent flyer on a registered sex offender\u2019s infamous jet than previously reported, with flight logs showing the former president taking at least 26 trips aboard the \u201cLolita Express\u201d \u2014 even apparently ditching his Secret Service detail for at least five of the flights, according to records obtained by FoxNews.com.\n\u201cClinton\u2019s presence aboard Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s Boeing 727 on 11 occasions has been reported, but flight logs show the number is more than double that, and trips between 2001 and 2003 included extended junkets around the world with Epstein and fellow passengers identified on manifests by their initials or first names, including \u201cTatiana.\u201d The tricked-out jet earned its Nabakov-inspired nickname because it was reportedly outfitted with a bed where passengers had group sex with young girls.\u201d\nFox News reports that Epstein served time in prison for \u201csolicitation and procurement of minors for prostitution. He allegedly had a team of traffickers who procured girls as young as 12 to service his friends on \u2018Orgy Island,\u2019 an estate on Epstein\u2019s 72-acre island, called Little St. James, in the U.S. Virgin Islands.\u201d http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/05/13/flight-logs-show-bill-clinton-flew-on-sex-offenders-jet-much-more-than-previously-known.html \nSome Internet sites, the credibility of which is unknown to me, have linked Hillary to these flights. http://truepundit.com/breaking-bombshell-nypd-blows-whistle-on-new-hillary-emails-money-laundering-sex-crimes-with-children-child-exploitation-pay-to-play-perjury/ \nThis kind of behavior seems reckless even for Bill and Hillary, who are accustomed to getting away with everything. Nevertheless, if you are an oligarch already worried about the reopened Hillary email case and additional FBI investigations, such as the one into the Clinton Foundation, and concerned about what else might emerge from the 650,000 emails on former US Rep. Weiner\u2019s computer and the NYPD pedophile investigation, putting Hillary in the Oval Office doesn\u2019t look like a good decision.\nAt this point, I would think that the Oligarchy would prefer to steal the election for Trump, instead of from him, rather than allow insouciant Americans to destroy America\u2019s reputation by choosing a person under felony investigations for president of the United States.\nBeing the \u201cexceptional nation\u201d takes on new meaning when there is a criminal at the helm.\nThe post Can The Oligarchy Still Steal The Presidential Election? \u2014 Paul Craig Roberts appeared first on PaulCraigRoberts.org .",

Print Email http://humansarefree.com/2016/11/actually-nobody-won-2016-presidential.html \u201cNobody for President, that\u2019s my campaign slogan,\u201d Nick Cannon asserted in \u201c Too Broke to Vote ,\u201d his viral criticism of the American electoral process from March of this year. Now, it turns out nobody for president won the 2016 election in a landslide.According to new voter turnout statistics from the 2016 election, 47 percent of Americans voted for nobody, far outweighing the votes cast for Trump (25.5 percent) and Hillary (25.6 percent) by eligible voters.And the \u201cI voted for nobody\u201d group is actually much larger than the 47 percent reported because that number only includes eligible voters.How many millions of Americans under the legal voting age \u2014 not to mention the countless millions who have lost their voting rights \u2014 voted for nobody, as well? Factoring in those individuals, around 193 million people did not vote for Trump or Clinton. That\u2019s nearly two-thirds of the population of the United States.Nobody also seemingly won the presidential primaries, with only 9 percent of Americans casting their votes for either Trump or Clinton. So when does nobody take office? Nobody won the majority of votes in the primaries or the general election, and the two main candidates who were running didn\u2019t \u201cwin\u201d the popular vote \u2014 they simply slightly outcompeted each other considering neither garnered over 50 percent of the eligible voters\u2019 ballots.That\u2019s where the real debate begins.As I wrote back in August when the primary voter turnout rates came in, one could argue that Trump (and Obama ) do not have a legitimate mandate to rule over the people of the United States. Trump did not win the majority of Americans\u2019 votes \u2014 not even close. When all Americans are included, Trump only garnered the votes of about 19 percent of us. This means the United States will be ruled over by a small minority of voters who elected someone to continually impose their political positions on the other 81 percent of us. Ron Paul: ' US Elections Are Rigged & Voting is Used to Pacify the Public ' Of course, as is the case with Democrats looking to assign blame for Hillary\u2019s loss, pundits and political pontificators argue the people who didn\u2019t vote have no right to complain about the outcome. After all, a non-vote or a vote for a third-party candidate was, in actuality, a vote for Trump. But that logic is flawed. The majority of Americans don\u2019t vote anymore because the political system no longer represents them . We\u2019ve been disenfranchised by decades of corrupt, unrepresentative politicians.The United States, according to a highly-cited academic study, is effectively an oligarchy \u201celected\u201d by a minority of voters ruled by a smaller minority of disliked politicians who represent an even smaller minority of billionaires and special interests. You know it, I know it, hell, even former U.S. President Jimmy Carter knows it . The majority of Americans voted for nobody not because they don\u2019t care or because they are apathetic \u2014 they voted no confidence in a political system that forgot about them a long time ago.

[ Note: Some words and/or phrases appearing in quotes in this report are English language approximations of Russian words/phrases having no exact counterpart.]\nAccording to this report, under the protocol and procedures outlined in the New Start Treaty that came into force on 5 February 2011 between the Federation and the United States, one of the obligations of the signing parties to reduce the risk of war is a notification process to take place when \u201c aberrations/sudden changes \u201d (departure from normal) are made\u2014and that occurred this past week when NORAD unexpectedly expanded its 17-21 October air defense exercises with Canada to now include the California region where just yesterday US warplanes conducted what they call \u201c security exercises \u201d.\nAs to the American\u2019s \u201c explanation/reasons \u201d for expanding the use of their warplanes over the continental United States (CONUS) with no foreign threat being known, this report explains, the Pentagon explained as being a \u201c National Special Security Event \u201d due to unspecified threats being posed to the national leadership of the US government and directly related to their presidential election.\nDeputy Defense Minister Tatiana Shevtsova , however, and shockingly, writes in this report that the American government is currently undergoing a \u201c silent coup \u201d pitting forces loyal to President Obama against those aligned with Hillary Clinton\u2014who was the former disgraced US Secretary of State and is facing an estimated 20 year prison sentence for obstruction justice and who, also, is being \u201c closed in upon \u201d by Obama\u2019s Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) who have launched a staggering 5 different criminal investigations against her and everyone of her inner circle .\nDeputy Minister Shevtsova further notes in this MoD report that the vast criminality of Hillary Clinton, and everyone associated with her, has been so exposed to the American public that President Obama\u2019s greatest fear now is that even if she were able to be elected, she could singlehandedly destroy the Democratic Party for decades to come\u2014an observation, curiously, supported by American experts who believe the same .\nEqually to be as feared by the Obama regime as Hillary Clinton, this report continues, is her campaign chairman John Podesta who is described as being adept at earning extraordinary sums of money via selling out the American public , and who Wikileaks revealed yesterday gave the order to destroy all of Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails that were under subpoena by the US Congress and that a US Federal Judge had, likewise, ordered to be returned to the US State Department.\nWith London\u2019s Guardian News Service having gone through all of Podesta\u2019s Wikileaks released emails , this report notes, even this far-leftist publication has been appalled at the level of corruption of Hillary Clinton and all who surround her\u2014and who wrote yesterday that the level of criminality surrounding Hillary Clinton \u201c points us toward the most fundamental thing we know about the people at the top of this class: their loyalty to one another and the way it overrides everything else \u201d.\nAs the six biggest US-based corporations supporting Hillary Clinton control some 90% of tens of thousands media outlets, including television channels, newspapers, magazines, radio stations and online editions (which means that the US media market is monopolized to a great extent and alternative outlets cannot be accessed in many towns), this report continues, the American people have awoken to the fact that their nation has fallen to 41 st out of 180 countries in the latest Reporters Without Borders Press Freedom Index to both their shame and amazement of what their criminal elites have done to them.\nAnd in the American peoples \u201c response/reaction \u201d to the horrors that their Hillary Clinton supporting criminal elite class has put them through, this report notes, they are even now massively rejecting the manipulation of polling data designed to keep them from voting \u2014and have, also, reacted in horror to YouTube, yesterday, censoring a Wall Street Journal video telling these people how they are being lied to and deceived.\nWith more empirical evidence showing Donald Trump is poised to win next weeks US presidential election in a landslide , and the Obama regime itself now turning against Hillary Clinton , this report grimly concludes, anyone believing that Hillary Clinton and her desperate criminal forces won\u2019t strike back to retake control of America would be gravely mistaken\u2014and the worst may be yet to come.",

        "body_en": "With fake polls running rampant everywhere, with Reuters/Ipsos just releasing yet another fake poll oversampling Democrats by 11% and including only \u201cLikely Voters\u201d, then showing the results with Hillary Clinton leading by 6%, we have decided to conduct our own poll.\nOur poll is a fair and unbiased poll. We have included Twitter hashtags for #DonaldTrump and #HillaryClinton as well as #GaryJohnson and #JillStein. It will reach both sides, thus being fully fair and balanced. Our poll also includes 3rd party candidates Libertarian Party candidate Gary Johnson and Green Party candidate Jill Stein. Voters can only vote once in our poll and their vote cannot be changed.\nThanks to Wikileaks email ID 26551 we now have confirmed data of what we all have long suspected, that polling agencies are being ordered to oversample as much as needed in order to artificially inflate the numbers of a specific candidates which has enough power to pull the strings or is simply preferred by the polling agency.\nMost mainstream media polls only include \u201cLikely Voters\u201d nowadays though it hasn\u2019t always been like this. According to their definition, Likely Voters means people who also voted in the previous elections. This is not an accurate way to measure the real preference out there because both Trump and Clinton benefit from what is known as first time voters. People who never voted before, people who feel disenfranchised by the system and who simply didn\u2019t want to vote before.\nThere is also the Millennial vote which is also impossible to include in the Likely Voters BS the media is pushing. Donald Trump is a revolutionary who vowed to change the system. This has brought millions of new people who never participated in the elections before. Bernie Sanders was also a revolutionary who vowed to do the exact same thing. Bernie lost or better said the election was stolen from him but that\u2019s another story. Bernie endorsed Hillary Clinton so, some of his voters have been transferred to Hillary Clinton now. Those first-time Bernie voters are also not included in the Likely Voters polls.\nSo without further due, we present to you our own OPEN POLL where everybody can vote only once. A fair an unbiased poll.\nWho will you vote for in the upcoming US presidential election 2016? Note: There is a poll embedded within this post, please visit the site to participate in this post's poll.",

Griffee / November 2, 2016 / DML REPORT / With only 6 days left before election day, Dennis Michael Lynch takes an electoral college map and shows how additional states will turn RED and get Trump over 270 electoral college votes to WIN the presidency. \nTaking states that the media has tried to downplay as if Trump has no chance to win them, DML shows how Trump not only has a chance, but predicts he WILL WIN these states, and he backs up his prediction with solid data and facts. \nDML also clarified that the polls are extremely misleading. He said Trump has lit a spark in people who have not voted in decades \u2013 some who have never voted \u2013 but now they are embracing Trump. These people are not being included in the polls. \nEarly voting is also not a true representation of what\u2019s about to happen, because more Democrats tend to show up for early voting, while the majority of Republicans wait until election day. \nWATCH THIS EYE-OPENING VIDEO for a critical state-by-state analysis that proves Trump can easily win the election \u2013 then SHARE IT EVERYWHERE! \n**Note: In the video when DML talks about PA voting for Trump, he forgot to mention 100k Democrats in PA switched parties over the past year. In addition, PA saw an eye-popping number of new voters register as Republicans. Combined, PA in this election has 240,000 more Republicans than it did in 2012. \nSign up to get alerts about Dennis Michael Lynch's upcoming Donald Trump film and breaking news. Subscribe",

Print Email http://humansarefree.com/2016/11/biggest-winners-and-losers-of-2016-us.html The biggest collective losers of the campaign were the mainstream media. Some of course were worse than others, but all of the old fashioned mainstream outlets were terrible. They operated on a basis of contempt for the honest concerns of ordinary people.They hid Hillary Clinton\u2019s scandals from public view as though oblivious to the fact that in the internet age, the truth cannot be hidden nor suppressed by the failing media-industrial complex.Long before Donald Trump declared his candidacy, the systematic problems of mainstream media in the west were well known.The total deceit with which they cover international affairs, slandering countries which do not actively pursue neoliberal policies, was in full view. Their job is to report the facts and collect information. Instead they have acted like mad agitators for their pet geopolitical projects.As the mainstream media begins to collapse, so too are common misconceptions about war and peace. In 2003 when mainstream media still had a fairly stern grip on public consciousness, many were duped into believing Bush and Blair\u2019s lies about Iraq. Thanks to new media, people in the west have a far better understanding of the realities in the Middle East than they did thirteen years ago. It explains why popular support for war in Syria and by extrapolation on Russia, something that the likes of Hillary Clinton have wildly campaigned for, remains deeply unpopular with ordinary people. The Biggest Winner After Donald Trump , the biggest winners were Julian Assange and Wikileaks . Wikileaks did what honest journalists ought to do, they publish information that is vital to the public interest without having a hidden agenda. Assange expressed his personal disdain for both Trump and Clinton and recently explained the scientific reasons why Wikileaks released damning information on Clinton and not Trump. In all he said he was fair minded and open minded.This remained the case despite Hillary and her supporters making death threats to Assange and Assange having his internet connection at the Ecuadorian Embassy in which he remains captive, cut off after the US State Department put pressure on the Government of Ecuador. But Assange persisted and leak after leak showed American voters and the wider world who Hillary Clinton actually is. It is a very different image from the sugar coated picture painted by the mainstream media. [Her allegiance to the Rothschilds and NWO master manipulator George Soros has also been confirmed , as well as her strong ties to Monsanto .]Wikileaks exposed how Hillary says one thing in public and other to her friends in Wall Street. Wikileaks exposed lie after lie, cover-up after cover-up. Julian Assange\u2019s place in history as someone who has exposed the lies of politicians like Hillary Clinton is now assured. He is owed a debt of gratitude by all those who value truth and justice. By Adam Garrie (excerpt) Dear Friends, HumansAreFree is and will always be free to access and use.
