        "body_en": "The Miami Herald stated that the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) endorses Hilary Rodham. Clinton. The organization is also the largest LGBTQ political group. The HRC has endorsed Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election.\r\nTheir new video advertisement features Clinton\u2019s pledge to fight for the LGBT community\u2019s equality. The ad was also released days before the election on Nov. 8.\r\nThe video titled \u201cHillary Clinton: Equality Is About Changing Hearts And Minds,\u201d was released in Washington D.C., which is the HRC headquarters are located.\r\nThe organization has a section of their website dedicated to the group\u2019s endorsement of the candidate. The HRC also stated that Clinton has stood with the LGBTQ community and the group will now stand with Clinton. The HRC concluded by saying that Clinton\u2019s fight is with the community and that what the HRC advocates.\r\nThe HRC President Chad Griffin said that Clinton has shown through her words and actions that she is dedicated to fighting for the rights of the LGBT community. He also stated that all of the progress the community has made is at stake in the 2016 Presidential election as the HRC has endorsed a candidate in the 2016 election.\r\nGriffin then continued to state that Donald Trump\u2019s campaign is filled with hateful language that will reverse the LGBTQ movement\u2019s gains. He also said that Clinton will tear down the walls of bigotry against people of alternative lifestyles. The HRC leader concluded by saying that it is very important that people who are pro-equality voters for Clinton in the next presidential election.\r\nBreitbart stated that an artist from the Art Wing Conspiracy group said a lot of Trump supporters, especially amongst the LGBT community, are \u201cin the closet.\u201d The artistic group has painted several Think Different posters across the city of San Francisco near the offices of Twitter and Clinton\u2019s campaign headquarters. The posters feature a rainbow Apple logo with a silhouette of Trump\u2019s face on it. They were released on National Coming Out Day.\r\nThe Art Wing Conspiracy artist also stated that on National Coming Out Day the organization encourages people to \u201cstop living a lie and come out.\u201d He conveyed this idea, in a voting booth, i.e. a closet, no one has to know who supports Trump or Clinton.\r\nThe artist also said that the liberal community in San Francisco must know that there are many Trump supporters amongst the city\u2019s LGBT community. The individual stated that having pride means to be true to oneself and one\u2019s beliefs, even if it is against the mainstream. The artist concluded that is what the LGBT rights movement conveys.\r\nThe Stonewall Inn\u2019s website stated that the historic inn was the birthplace of the historic LGBT rights movement. The patrons of the club retaliated against harassment from the local police department. Subsequently, a riot occurred on June 28, 1969.\r\nThe website also claimed that the patrons refused to accept the status quo of oppression for the first time. They then stood up for each other and the whole LGBT community.\r\nThe site continues to state that the riot at the Stonewall Inn sparked the lengthy battle for all members of the Gay and Lesbian community. The incident is often referred to as the Rosa Parks incident of the LGBT community. The site then stated that the incident led the government and society, in general, to look at members of the LBGT community as equals.\r\nIn 1969 the police raided gay clubs regularly. Eight police officers arrived at the Stonewall Inn on a Saturday morning at 1:20. Approximately 200 people were in the establishment that night. However, the raid was not conducted as planned. The patrons did not cooperate, resulting in the riot that led to the LGBT rights movement of the 1970s, which is why the HRC now exists and has endorsed a candidate for the 2016 election.\r\nBy John A.

        "body_en": "at 11:29 am 2 Comments \r\nElection 2016 has been extremely bittersweet for me. On the positive side, through both the Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump grassroots movements, we have seen clear proof that a huge number of Americans accurately understand that the current system is totally rigged and simply not working for them. These people didn\u2019t migrate toward these two candidates for some tweaks to the system here and there, their supporters want full scale paradigm level change. \r\nAs such, rather than dwelling on the differences between these two populist movements, let\u2019s consider some of the areas where they overlap. \r\n1. Trade \u2014 Opposition to NAFTA and current \u201ctrade\u201d deals such as TPP, TTIP, and TISA have been central to both the Sanders and Trump campaigns. \r\n2. War and militarism \u2014 Whether you believe Trump is sincere or not, opposition to Obama/Clinton interventionist overseas wars were key talking points for both Trump and Sanders. \r\n3. The system is rigged \u2014 The painful acknowledgment that the U.S. economic system is a rigged scam that fails to reward hard work, and is more akin to a parasitic, predatory oligarchy with very limited social mobility, has been a key campaign theme for both Trump and Sanders. The economy is increasingly dominated by near-monoploy giants who relentlessly push for more power and more profits irrespective of the cost to society, whether that cost be war, poverty or social unrest. \r\n4. Money in politics \u2014 The rigged economic system described above aggregates wealth into an increasingly small number of hands. Those hands then buy off politicians and rig the political process. A rigged economy and rigged political system perpetually feeds itself and endlessly grows at the expense of the public like a terminal cancer. Both Trump and Sanders emphasized this problem. \r\n5. Rule of law is dead \u2014 Sanders focused on Wall Street bankers, while Trump focused on Hillary and her inner circle of cronies, but the overall point is the same. Rich and powerful oligarchs are above the law. We all know this, but Washington D.C. refuses to do anything about. \r\nDespite all of the above, the ultimate status quo candidate, Hillary Clinton, has a very good chance of winning tomorrow\u2019s election. Why? Primarily because Donald Trump is a very divisive figure who focused too much on polarizing issues such as building a wall, stop-and-frisk, supporting torture, advocating for internet censorship and libel laws, etc. While he got his act together toward the end of the campaign, he spent far too much of it marginalizing people like me who desperately want to vanquish the status quo, but couldn\u2019t get comfortable with Trump. \r\nThis is where the election took on a decidedly negative tone for me on a personal basis. I\u2019ve dedicated the last six years of my life to fully exposing and combating status quo corruption, but when the populist revolt finally arrived, the only choice I was given for change was one I couldn\u2019t embrace. For someone so passionately yearning for positive, paradigm-level change, that\u2019s been a crushing letdown. Personally, I\u2019ve passed the point where I\u2019m willing to vote for someone I don\u2019t believe in or trust. As such, I won\u2019t be voting for either one. That said, my individual vote is irrelevant, and I don\u2019t want to focus on that. The bigger question is, who do I think will win? \r\nOn that question, I don\u2019t have a strong opinion at the moment. Ultimately, it depends on whether Americans go into the voting booth and see status quo vs. blowing up the status quo, or if they see Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton. If they see the former, odds are in Trump\u2019s favor. If they see the latter, it\u2019s a matter of which personality Americans find least repulsive. \r\nSo here we stand. Despite the fact that a huge percentage of Americans deem both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton to be \u201cunelectable,\u201d one of them is about to be elected. As such, we really need to start thinking and strategizing about the future. In that regard, I propose we look at the five points of Sanders/Trump overlap I highlighted earlier. If we can stay focused on those existential issues after the election irrespective of who wins, \u201cwe the people\u201d have a good chance of uniting a clear majority of the population and ultimately turning this national disaster around. \r\nOr we can allow ourselves to be divided and conquered into oblivion. The choice is ours. \r\nIn Liberty,",

\u2014and that is further validated by the over 700,000 Americans who have come to his campaign rallies, as opposed to the barely 60,000 that have attended Hillary Clinton\u2019s .\r\nMost fascinating though of the \u201coutliers\u201d used in this Security Council report is the psychological analysis of the American electorate conducted by a virtually unknown US political project called \u201c We Need Smith \u201d\u2014whose scientifically conducted studies shockingly proved that anyone from a liberal Democrat, to a conservative Republican was able to win the US presidency as long as they promised to destroy the corrupt political system currently ruling America .\r\nThe \u201cWe Need Smith\u201d project, this report explains, is named after a popular US Great Depression era movie called Mr. Smith Goes To Washington about a newly appointed United States Senator who fights against a corrupt political system\u2014and that during this present US presidential election only Donald Trump and US Senator Bernie Sanders fit the mold of.\r\nCritical to note about the \u201cWe Need Smith\u201d project too, this report continues, is that it was co-founded by the legendary American pollster Patrick Caddell \u2014who almost singlehandedly was responsible for putting President Jimmy Carter in office in 1976, but also presided over Carter\u2019s unprecedented defeat in 1980 at the hands of the US establishments most hated candidate Ronald Reagan.\r\nSeeking to understand how President Carter could go from victory to defeat in just 4 years, this report details, Patrick Caddell spent the past nearly 4 decades examining it\u2014and coming to the scientific conclusion that the conventional wisdom that America is absolutely divided into warring tribes is simply not true, they are all just tired of being lied to .\r\nIn fact, this report continues, Caddell\u2019s research proved that the American political battleground is no longer over ideology but instead is all about

Arnoldski - \r\n\r\n\r\nThe US Federal Bureau of Investigation has directly pressured Russian diplomats and forbid them from being near voting places during the presidential elections in the United States on November 8th. Maria Zakharova, the spokeswoman of the Russian foreign ministry, wrote about this on her Facebook page on Monday. \r\n\u201cIt\u2019s come to openly intimidating the staff of diplomatic agencies. The State Department recommended Russian representatives in a memo \u2018not to come to polling stations on their own\u2019, and some states\u2019 authorities have gone even further and threatened criminal prosecution. This means that they can\u2019t even watch the voting procedure,\u201d Zakharova wrote. \r\nAccording to Zakharova, in recent days, direct pressure has been put on Russian representatives in the United States by the FBI, \u201cwhose agents, with undisguised threats, have let us know that we should not be interested in the American elections.\u201d \r\n\u201cIn Houston, in order to offer such a \u2018warning,\u2019 a Hollywood-style special operation was arranged that blocked the car of our Consulate General\u2019s employees on the street. They stopped the car and started to \u2018convince\u2019 them that they should not watch the voting, and not even think about it,\u201d Zakharova added. \r\n\r\nIn connection with the incident with the Russian embassy in Washington, a relevant submission has already been made to the State Department.  \r\n\u201cBut the question arises: what can a foreign diplomat see at American polling stations that is so important that they\u2019ve brought in \u2018Mr. Smith\u2019, and why are election monitoring procedures controlled by the FBI?!\u201d, the Russian foreign ministry\u2019s representative concluded.  \r\n\r\n     Follow us on Facebook!                                                   \r\n                                                   \r\n\r\n       Follow us on Twitter! \r\n                               \r\n\r\n             Donate!",

        "body_en": "http://humansarefree.com/2016/11/john-mccain-to-donald-trump-dont-you.html Sit down. This is going to shock you. (Not). We reported yesterday on the telephone call between US president-elect Trump and Russian president Putin, where the current and future presidents discussed the need to set aside differences and look to more constructive future relations. With serious observers of this past year's increasing tensions between US and Russia openly worrying about a nuclear war breaking out, with some 300,000 NATO troops placed on Russia's border, with sanctions hurting average businesspersons on both sides, a normal person might look at the slight thaw in Cold War 2.0 as an early positive indicator of the end of the Obama Era.Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) begs to differ.In a blistering statement he released today responding to the Trump/Putin telephone call, Sen. McCain condemned any efforts by President-elect Trump to find common ground with Putin. Any claim by Putin that he wants to improve relations with the US must be vigorously opposed, writes McCain. He explains: \"We should place as much faith in such statements as any other made by a former KGB agent who has plunged his country into tyranny, murdered his political opponents, invaded his neighbors, threatened America\u2019s allies, and attempted to undermine America\u2019s elections.\" Interesting that Republican McCain has taken to using the Hillary Clinton campaign line (the one that lost her the election) that somehow the Russians were manipulating the US electoral process. The claim was never backed up by facts and Hillary's claim that some 17 US intelligence agencies agreed with her was shown to be a dangerous and foolish lie.Why is Putin not to be trusted, according to McCain? \"Vladimir Putin has rejoined Bashar Assad in his barbaric war against the Syrian people with the resumption of large-scale Russian air and missile strikes in Idlib and Homs. Another brutal assault on the city of Aleppo could soon follow.\" What McCain doesn't say is that unlike US troops in Syria, the Russians are invited by the Syrian government and operate according to international law . Oh yes, and they are also fighting al-Qaeda and ISIS , which has sought to overthrow Assad for the past five years. Maybe McCain is just really sensitive after meeting with al-Qaeda and ISIS in Syria? As rumors swirl from Washington about neocons sniffing out top jobs in the incoming administration, it would serve president-elect Trump well to reflect on he true nature of the neocon beast...

        "body_en": "Dispatches from STEPHEN LENDMAN H ad Comey recommended Hillary be held criminally responsible for mishandling classified State Department documents last July, along with perjury for lying to the FBI and Congress, a firestorm of criticism wouldn\u2019t have followed his Friday announcement. \r\n1. THE COMEY IMBROGLIO \r\nSenate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D. NV) accused him of \u201ctarring Secretary Clinton with thin innuendo,\u201d saying his action \u201cappears to be a clear intent to aid one political party over another\u201d \u2013 claiming he \u201cmay have broken the law,\u201d citing the 1939 Hatch Act (An Act to Prevent Pernicious Political Activities). It prohibits federal executive branch employees from engaging in certain forms of political activity \u2013 exempting the president, vice president and designated high-level administration officials. Proof of intent is required to hold someone culpable under the law. .. According to the Wall Street Journal , within the FBI, there was \u201c sharp internal disagreement over matters related to the Clintons, and how to handle those matters fairly and carefully in the middle of a national election campaign.\u201d .. In a prominently featured NYT op-ed , Law Professor Richard Painter said \u201c(w)e cannot allow FBI or Justice Department officials to unnecessarily publicize pending investigations concerning candidates of either party while an election is underway. That is an abuse of power.\u201d .. Not according to former federal prosecutor Daniel Richman, saying \u201cComey\u2019s critics cannot show his letter violated the Hatch Act unless they can prove that the FBI director was intending to influence the election rather than inform Congress, which was (his) stated aim.\u201d .. A Sunday released ABC News/Washington Post poll indicated about a third of likely voters are less likely to support Hillary following Comey\u2019s October surprise. .. The Washington Post said the Justice Department\u2019s public integrity unit blocked the FBI from investigating the Clinton Foundation, claiming inadequate \u201cevidence to move forward.\u201d The department is run by longtime Bill and Hillary ally, Attorney General Loretta Lynch. Last June, she met privately with the former president at Phoenix\u2019s Sky Harbor airport while Hillary was under FBI investigation \u2013 a clear conflict of interest despite her disingenuously claiming \u201cno discussion of any matter pending for the department or any matter pending for any other body\u201d took place. .. In a Washington Post op-ed , former attorney general Eric Holder expressed concern about Comey\u2019s \u201cvague letter to Congress about emails potentially connected to a matter of public, and political, interest\u201d \u2013 claiming he \u201cviolated long-standing Justice Department policies and tradition.\u201d .. Holder disgraced the office he held. Law Professor Francis Boyle called him \u201ca total disaster for the United States Constitution, the Bill of Rights, Human Rights and the Rule of Law.\u201d Speaking in Florida on Sunday, Hillary changed the subject, saying \u201c there\u2019s a lot of noise and distraction, but it really comes down to what kind of future we want, and what kind of president can help us get there. We won\u2019t be distracted no matter what our opponents throw at us.\u201d .. Clearly, Comey\u2019s bombshell changed the dynamic of the race, whether enough to derail her White House bid we\u2019ll know in days. Reports indicate the FBI will examine an astonishing 650,000 emails from former Congressman Anthony Weiner\u2019s laptop \u2013 estranged husband of top Hillary aide Huma Abedin. .. \r\nIt could take months to review volume this immense, likely extending well beyond November 8 and January\u2019s inauguration, to determine if any evidence warrants prosecuting Hillary, Abedin, Weiner or anyone else for mishandling classified government documents, perhaps compromising national security. \r\n2. INTELLECTUAL LAZINESS & SELF-INFLICTED POLITICAL IDIOCY \r\nHarvard Undergrads for Hillary \r\nOVERWHELMING SYSTEMIC PROPAGANDA ALLIED WITH A PERVASIVE INTELLECTUAL LAZINESS CONSPIRE TO KEEP MINDS THAT SHOULD KNOW BETTER FROM SEEING THE MOST ELEMENTARY TRUTHS. BEING OFFICIALLY \u201cSMART\u201d IS NO VACCINE AGAINST THE BRAINWASH. A ccording to the student newspaper Harvard Crimson\u2019s October survey , 87% of undergrads support Hillary. A scant 6% back Trump, 5.8% for Libertarian Gary (\u201cwhat\u2019s Aleppo\u201d) Johnson, and less than 1% for Harvard College and Medical School graduate Jill Stein \u2013 the only people\u2019s candidate running. .. Around one-third of undergrads responded (2,128 out of a total 6,645 student body) \u2013 so the views of nonrespondents aren\u2019t known. About 91% are eligible to vote in November. Eligibility begins at age 18. A surprising 96% of respondents intend voting, they said. .. The national average is far lower. Whether this year\u2019s contentious election encourages a larger than usual turnout remains to be seen. The Crimson poll was conducted from October 10 \u2013 20 \u2013 before FBI Director Comey\u2019s October surprise. Whether it would have changed the results is unknown. Two-thirds of respondents said they support Democrat party candidates, 12% calling themselves Republicans, 19% saying they\u2019re independents. .. Trump and Hillary are the most widely reviled presidential aspirants in US history. Yet 70% of Crimson respondents view her favorably \u2013 showing little knowledge of her deplorable public record since the 1990s unless they support her war crimes, racketeering and perjury. What to make of it? Undergrads enter Harvard (and other colleges) as teenagers, young and naive as I was when entering the college long ago. .. After graduation, I discovered the meaning of the term \u201ccommencement.\u201d Institutions like Harvard teach students to be good citizens, omitting the ugly stuff about US imperialism, officials advancing it, waging endless wars of aggression. .. The so-called Korean War was ongoing when I was there, an incentive to maintain good grades, stay in school, avoid being drafted and sent to North Korea\u2019s frozen Chosin, an expression used by members of my class. .. The Paper Chase Hollywood film (1973) featured John Houseman as stern Harvard Law School Professor Charles Kingsfield. His most memorable line on day one for first year students was saying \u201c(y)ou teach yourselves the law, but I train your minds. You come here with a skull full of mush. You leave thinking like a lawyer.\u201d .. I began my freshman year \u201cwith a skull full of mush,\u201d gradually extracting it. College and graduate school taught me to think. Learning and comprehension mostly came later. The older I get, the greater my understanding of world and national issues. .. I\u2019m long removed from campus life. Back then, students had none of the advantages available today \u2013 no computers, no Internet. Daily writing I dearly love now was a dreaded chore back then \u2013 requiring research by rolodex cards and library stacks, a time-consuming process. Except for the type primary research I did for my master\u2019s thesis, most everything needed today for compositions or articles like mine is available on our desktops. .. It\u2019s understandable why young minds haven\u2019t achieved the wisdom of the ages. Still it\u2019s disturbing to find Harvard undergrads uninformed and out-of-touch on Hillary\u2019s deplorable public record \u2013 when it\u2019s so easy to research it and know what she and husband Bill are all about. .. Why hasn\u2019t the Harvard student body done its homework for perhaps the most important election in our lifetime. The stakes are huge \u2013 possible war on Russia with Hillary empowered or improved bilateral relations under Trump. Nothing matters more than saving humanity from the scourge of catastrophic thermonuclear war able to kill us all.

        "body_en": "Leave a reply \r\nPaul Craig Roberts \u2013 The election was set up to be stolen from Trump. That was the purpose of the polls rigged by overweighting Hillary supporters in the samples. After weeks of hearing poll results that Hillary was in the lead, the public would discount a theft claim. Electronic voting makes elections easy to steal, and I have posted explanations by election fraud experts of how it is done. \r\nClearly the Oligarchy does not want Donald Trump in the White House as they are unsure that they could control him, and Hillary is their agent. \r\nWith the reopening of the FBI investigation of Hillary and related scandals exploding all around her, election theft is not only more risky but also less likely to serve the Oligarchy\u2019s own interests. \r\nImage as well as money is part of Oligarchic power. The image of America takes a big hit if the American people elect a president who is currently under felony investigation. \r\nMoreover, a President Hillary would be under investigation for years. With so much spotlight on her, she would not be able to serve the Oligarchy\u2019s interests. She would be worthless to them, and, indeed, investigations that unearthed various connections between Hillary and oligarchs could damage the oligarchs. \r\nIn other words, for the Oligarchy Hillary has moved from an asset to a liability. \r\nA Hillary presidency could put our country into chaos. I doubt the oligarchs are sufficiently stupid to think that once she is sworn in, Hillary can fire FBI Director Comey and shut down the investigation. The last president that tried that was Richard Nixon, and look where that got him. \r\nMoreover, the Republicans in the House and Senate would not stand for it. House Committee on oversight and Government Reform chairman Jason Chaffetz has already declared Hillary to be \u201ca target-rich environment. Even before we get to day one, we\u2019ve got two years worth of material already lined up.\u201d House Speaker Paul Ryan said investigation will follow the evidence. \r\nIf you were an oligarch, would you want your agent under this kind of scrutiny? If you were Hillary, would you want to be under this kind of pressure? \r\nWhat happens if the FBI recommends the indictment of the president? Even insouciant Americans would see the cover-up if the attorney general refused to prosecute the case. Americans would lose all confidence in the government. Chaos would rule. Chaos can be revolutionary, and that is not good for oligarchs. \r\nMoreover, if reports can be believed, salacious scandals appear to be waiting their time on stage. For example, last May Fox News reported: \r\n\u201cFormer President Bill Clinton was a much more frequent flyer on a registered sex offender\u2019s infamous jet than previously reported, with flight logs showing the former president taking at least 26 trips aboard the \u201cLolita Express\u201d \u2014 even apparently ditching his Secret Service detail for at least five of the flights, according to records obtained by FoxNews.com. \u201cClinton\u2019s presence aboard Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s Boeing 727 on 11 occasions has been reported, but flight logs show the number is more than double that, and trips between 2001 and 2003 included extended junkets around the world with Epstein and fellow passengers identified on manifests by their initials or first names, including \u201cTatiana.\u201d The tricked-out jet earned its Nabakov-inspired nickname because it was reportedly outfitted with a bed where passengers had group sex with young girls.\u201d \r\nFox News reports that Epstein served time in prison for \u201csolicitation and procurement of minors for prostitution. He allegedly had a team of traffickers who procured girls as young as 12 to service his friends on \u2018Orgy Island,\u2019 an estate on Epstein\u2019s 72-acre island, called Little St. James, in the U.S. Virgin Islands.\u201d http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/05/13/flight-logs-show-bill-clinton-flew-on-sex-offenders-jet-much-more-than-previously-known.html \r\nSome Internet sites, the credibility of which is unknown to me, have linked Hillary to these flights. http://truepundit.com/breaking-bombshell-nypd-blows-whistle-on-new-hillary-emails-money-laundering-sex-crimes-with-children-child-exploitation-pay-to-play-perjury/ \r\nThis kind of behavior seems reckless even for Bill and Hillary, who are accustomed to getting away with everything. Nevertheless, if you are an oligarch already worried about the reopened Hillary email case and additional FBI investigations, such as the one into the Clinton Foundation, and concerned about what else might emerge from the 650,000 emails on former US Rep. Weiner\u2019s computer and the NYPD pedophile investigation, putting Hillary in the Oval Office doesn\u2019t look like a good decision. \r\nAt this point, I would think that the Oligarchy would prefer to steal the election for Trump, instead of from him, rather than allow insouciant Americans to destroy America\u2019s reputation by choosing a person under felony investigations for president of the United States. \r\nBeing the \u201cexceptional nation\u201d takes on new meaning when there is a criminal at the helm.

For example, last May Fox News reported: \r\n\u201cFormer President Bill Clinton was a much more frequent flyer on a registered sex offender\u2019s infamous jet than previously reported, with flight logs showing the former president taking at least 26 trips aboard the \u201cLolita Express\u201d \u2014 even apparently ditching his Secret Service detail for at least five of the flights, according to records obtained by FoxNews.com. \r\n\u201cClinton\u2019s presence aboard Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s Boeing 727 on 11 occasions has been reported, but flight logs show the number is more than double that, and trips between 2001 and 2003 included extended junkets around the world with Epstein and fellow passengers identified on manifests by their initials or first names, including \u201cTatiana.\u201d The tricked-out jet earned its Nabakov-inspired nickname because it was reportedly outfitted with a bed where passengers had group sex with young girls.\u201d \r\nFox News reports that Epstein served time in prison for \u201csolicitation and procurement of minors for prostitution. He allegedly had a team of traffickers who procured girls as young as 12 to service his friends on \u2018Orgy Island,\u2019 an estate on Epstein\u2019s 72-acre island, called Little St. James, in the U.S. Virgin Islands.\u201d http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/05/13/flight-logs-show-bill-clinton-flew-on-sex-offenders-jet-much-more-than-previously-known.html Some Internet sites, the credibility of which is unknown to me, have linked Hillary to these flights. http://truepundit.com/breaking-bombshell-nypd-blows-whistle-on-new-hillary-emails-money-laundering-sex-crimes-with-children-child-exploitation-pay-to-play-perjury/ \r\nThis kind of behavior seems reckless even for Bill and Hillary, who are accustomed to getting away with everything. Nevertheless, if you are an oligarch already worried about the reopened Hillary email case and additional FBI investigations, such as the one into the Clinton Foundation, and concerned about what else might emerge from the 650,000 emails on former US Rep. Weiner\u2019s computer and the NYPD pedophile investigation, putting Hillary in the Oval Office doesn\u2019t look like a good decision. \r\nAt this point, I would think that the Oligarchy would prefer to steal the election for Trump, instead of from him, rather than allow insouciant Americans to destroy America\u2019s reputation by choosing a person under felony investigations for president of the United States. \r\nBeing the \u201cexceptional nation\u201d takes on new meaning when there is a criminal at the helm.

        "body_en": "U.S. militia girds for trouble as presidential election nears 11/02/2016 \r\nREUTERS \r\nDown a Georgia country road, camouflaged members of the Three Percent Security Force have mobilized for rifle practice, hand-to-hand combat training \u2014 and an impromptu campaign rally for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. \r\n\u201cHow many people are voting for Trump? Ooh-rah!\u201d asks Chris Hill, a paralegal who goes by the code name \u201cBloodagent.\u201d \r\n\u201cOoh-rah!\u201d shout a dozen militia members in response, as morning sunlight sifted through the trees last weekend. \r\nAs the most divisive presidential election in recent memory nears its conclusion, some armed militia groups are preparing for the possibility of a stolen election on Nov. 8 and civil unrest in the days following a victory by Democrat Hillary Clinton. \r\nThey say they won\u2019t fire the first shot, but they\u2019re not planning to leave their guns at home, either. \r\nTrump\u2019s populist campaign has energized militia members like Hill, who admire the Republican mogul\u2019s promise to deport illegal immigrants, stop Muslims from entering the country and build a wall along the Mexico border. Trump has repeatedly warned that the election may be \u201crigged,\u201d and has said he may not respect the results if he does not win. At least one paramilitary group, the Oath Keepers, has called on members to monitor voting sites for signs of fraud. \r\nArmed paramilitary groups first gained prominence in the early 1990s, fueled by confrontations in Ruby Ridge, Idaho and Waco, Texas, culminating in a militia sympathizer\u2019s 1995 bombing of a federal office building in Oklahoma City that killed 168 people. \r\nTheir numbers dwindled following that attack but have spiked in recent years, driven by fears that President Barack Obama will threaten gun ownership and erode the power of local government. The Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks extremist groups, estimates there were 276 active militias last year, up from 42 in 2008. \r\nIn recent years, armed groups have confronted federal authorities in a series of land-use disputes in the western United States. Federal officials fear more clashes could come after seven militants were acquitted on conspiracy charges for occupying a federal wildlife refuge in Oregon. \r\nMany fear Clinton would push the county further to the left. \r\n\u201cThis is the last chance to save America from ruin,\u201d Hill said. \u201cI\u2019m surprised I was able to survive or suffer through eight years of Obama without literally going insane, but Hillary is going to be more of the same.\u201d \r\n\r\nEXTREMIST GROUPS EMBOLDENED \r\nThe Oath Keepers, a prominent anti-government force that sent gun-toting members to the 2014 race riots in Ferguson, Missouri, called on members last week to monitor voting sites on election day for any signs of fraud. \r\nAn hour south of Atlanta, the Three Percent Security Force started the day around the campfire, taking turns shooting automatic pistols and rifles at a makeshift target range. They whooped with approval when blasts from one member\u2019s high-powered rifle knocked down a tree. \r\nThe group operates independently, but is affiliated with a national armed movement that calls for members to defend individual rights in the face of what they see as an overreaching federal government. The movement draws its name from the notion that no more than 3 percent of the American population fought in the Revolutionary War against Britain. \r\nAmid the war games, Hill weighed plans for a possible armed march on Washington if Clinton wins. \r\nHe said he doesn\u2019t want his members leading the way, but they will defend the protesters if need be. His group will not hesitate to act if a President Clinton tries to disarm gun owners, he said. \r\n\u201cI will be there to render assistance to my fellow countrymen, and prevent them from being disarmed, and I will fight and I will kill and I may die in the process,\u201d said Hill, who founded the militia several years ago. \r\nTrump\u2019s candidacy has emboldened extremist groups to speak more openly about challenging the rule of law, said Ryan Lenz, a researcher at the Southern Poverty Law Center. \r\n\u201cPrior to this campaign season, these ideas were relegated to sort of the political fringe of the American political landscape,\u201d he said. \u201cNow these ideas are legitimized.\u201d \r\nOver the past week, some prominent Trump supporters have hinted at violence. \r\n\u201cIf Trump loses, I\u2019m grabbing my musket,\u201d former Illinois Representative Joe Walsh wrote on Twitter last week. Conservative commentator Wayne Root fantasized about Clinton\u2019s death while speaking at a Trump rally in Las Vegas on Sunday. \r\nBack in Georgia, the Three Percent Security Force wrapped up rifle practice in the midday sun. They then headed further into the trees to tackle an obstacle course with loaded pistols at their sides, ready for whatever may come. \r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve building up for this, just like the Marines,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are going to really train harder and try to increase our operational capabilities in the event that this is the day that we hoped would never come.\u201d Share On:",

Print Email http://humansarefree.com/2016/11/biggest-winners-and-losers-of-2016-us.html The biggest collective losers of the campaign were the mainstream media. Some of course were worse than others, but all of the old fashioned mainstream outlets were terrible. They operated on a basis of contempt for the honest concerns of ordinary people.They hid Hillary Clinton\u2019s scandals from public view as though oblivious to the fact that in the internet age, the truth cannot be hidden nor suppressed by the failing media-industrial complex.Long before Donald Trump declared his candidacy, the systematic problems of mainstream media in the west were well known.The total deceit with which they cover international affairs, slandering countries which do not actively pursue neoliberal policies, was in full view. Their job is to report the facts and collect information. Instead they have acted like mad agitators for their pet geopolitical projects.As the mainstream media begins to collapse, so too are common misconceptions about war and peace. In 2003 when mainstream media still had a fairly stern grip on public consciousness, many were duped into believing Bush and Blair\u2019s lies about Iraq. Thanks to new media, people in the west have a far better understanding of the realities in the Middle East than they did thirteen years ago. It explains why popular support for war in Syria and by extrapolation on Russia, something that the likes of Hillary Clinton have wildly campaigned for, remains deeply unpopular with ordinary people. The Biggest Winner After Donald Trump , the biggest winners were Julian Assange and Wikileaks . Wikileaks did what honest journalists ought to do, they publish information that is vital to the public interest without having a hidden agenda. Assange expressed his personal disdain for both Trump and Clinton and recently explained the scientific reasons why Wikileaks released damning information on Clinton and not Trump. In all he said he was fair minded and open minded.This remained the case despite Hillary and her supporters making death threats to Assange and Assange having his internet connection at the Ecuadorian Embassy in which he remains captive, cut off after the US State Department put pressure on the Government of Ecuador. But Assange persisted and leak after leak showed American voters and the wider world who Hillary Clinton actually is. It is a very different image from the sugar coated picture painted by the mainstream media. [Her allegiance to the Rothschilds and NWO master manipulator George Soros has also been confirmed , as well as her strong ties to Monsanto .]Wikileaks exposed how Hillary says one thing in public and other to her friends in Wall Street. Wikileaks exposed lie after lie, cover-up after cover-up. Julian Assange\u2019s place in history as someone who has exposed the lies of politicians like Hillary Clinton is now assured. He is owed a debt of gratitude by all those who value truth and justice. By Adam Garrie (excerpt) Dear Friends, HumansAreFree is and will always be free to access and use.

Print Email http://humansarefree.com/2016/11/actually-nobody-won-2016-presidential.html \u201cNobody for President, that\u2019s my campaign slogan,\u201d Nick Cannon asserted in \u201c Too Broke to Vote ,\u201d his viral criticism of the American electoral process from March of this year. Now, it turns out nobody for president won the 2016 election in a landslide.According to new voter turnout statistics from the 2016 election, 47 percent of Americans voted for nobody, far outweighing the votes cast for Trump (25.5 percent) and Hillary (25.6 percent) by eligible voters.And the \u201cI voted for nobody\u201d group is actually much larger than the 47 percent reported because that number only includes eligible voters.How many millions of Americans under the legal voting age \u2014 not to mention the countless millions who have lost their voting rights \u2014 voted for nobody, as well? Factoring in those individuals, around 193 million people did not vote for Trump or Clinton. That\u2019s nearly two-thirds of the population of the United States.Nobody also seemingly won the presidential primaries, with only 9 percent of Americans casting their votes for either Trump or Clinton. So when does nobody take office? Nobody won the majority of votes in the primaries or the general election, and the two main candidates who were running didn\u2019t \u201cwin\u201d the popular vote \u2014 they simply slightly outcompeted each other considering neither garnered over 50 percent of the eligible voters\u2019 ballots.That\u2019s where the real debate begins.As I wrote back in August when the primary voter turnout rates came in, one could argue that Trump (and Obama ) do not have a legitimate mandate to rule over the people of the United States. Trump did not win the majority of Americans\u2019 votes \u2014 not even close. When all Americans are included, Trump only garnered the votes of about 19 percent of us. This means the United States will be ruled over by a small minority of voters who elected someone to continually impose their political positions on the other 81 percent of us. Ron Paul: ' US Elections Are Rigged & Voting is Used to Pacify the Public ' Of course, as is the case with Democrats looking to assign blame for Hillary\u2019s loss, pundits and political pontificators argue the people who didn\u2019t vote have no right to complain about the outcome. After all, a non-vote or a vote for a third-party candidate was, in actuality, a vote for Trump. But that logic is flawed. The majority of Americans don\u2019t vote anymore because the political system no longer represents them . We\u2019ve been disenfranchised by decades of corrupt, unrepresentative politicians.The United States, according to a highly-cited academic study, is effectively an oligarchy \u201celected\u201d by a minority of voters ruled by a smaller minority of disliked politicians who represent an even smaller minority of billionaires and special interests. You know it, I know it, hell, even former U.S. President Jimmy Carter knows it . The majority of Americans voted for nobody not because they don\u2019t care or because they are apathetic \u2014 they voted no confidence in a political system that forgot about them a long time ago.

        "body_en": "at 1:43 pm 3 Comments \r\nBy now, everyone on planet earth has heard about the bombshell news just announced by the FBI that it was re-opening its investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s private email server. Here\u2019s the text of FBI head James Comey\u2019s letter to Congressional leaders. \r\nObviously, lots of people are out there pontificating on what, if anything, this means. As such, I\u2019m going to add my two cents to the conversation. \r\nI\u2019ve prided myself on unemotionally calling this election how I see it the whole time, because I\u2019m neither a Hillary Clinton nor Donald Trump supporter. Being free of the tremendous baggage that comes with cheerleading a particular candidate in this contentious election, I had consistently predicted a Trump victory until the Access Hollywood tape emerged. At that point I penned a thought-piece titled, Donald Trump is in Trouble \u2013 Part 2 , in which I changed my forecast to a Hillary Clinton victory. \r\nHere\u2019s some of what I wrote: \r\nAfter watching yesterday\u2019s audio and reading through the Wikileaks revelations, my prediction has changed for the first time this election. All things equal from here on out (meaning no additional huge revelations against Hillary), I think Hillary Clinton will defeat Donald Trump. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be a landslide, but I think she\u2019s probably going to win. The audio was very harmful for Donald Trump, and now I\u2019m going to explain why. \r\nFirst of all, if you want to accurately forecast the outcome of this election you need to get into the minds of the masses. Just like trading financial markets, what you think is right doesn\u2019t matter. What matters is what everyone else collectively thinks, and whether or not they\u2019re going to get off their asses and vote. A big part of why I thought Trump would win related to the fact that I believe many people were simply looking for an excuse to vote for him. Justified disgust with the status quo in general, and Hillary Clinton in particular, pushed millions of Americans into the camp of being willing to take a gamble on Trump despite disliking him personally and disagreeing with him on many issues. I felt strongly that there were millions upon millions of Americans you could place into this category \u2014 people who were \u201cflirting with the idea of voting Trump.\u201d I believe a significant amount of these people will not vote for him as a result of the audio. Will it be the majority of them? Probably not, but it will be a material number and arguably enough to swing the election. No, I don\u2019t think these voters will shift to Hillary, and no, I don\u2019t think committed Trump voters will change their minds. However, I do think enough of these willing to be convinced, leaning-Trump types will now stay home or vote third party. It\u2019s these voters who I expected to swing the election in Trump\u2019s favor, and they are now unreliable. \r\nDoes Trump\u2019s vulgarity excuse the incalculable crimes of Hillary Clinton and her husband, making them preferable in this election? No it doesn\u2019t, but that\u2019s not the point of this article. Most voters are too superficial, too busy trying to survive and too uninformed to weigh all the very important issues rationally. As an example, think about how most conversations are going to go down this weekend. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re out with a bunch of friends for drinks tonight. Someone says, \u201cso have you seen the Trump audio?\u201d If someone in the group hasn\u2019t, someone will pull out their phone and it\u2019ll be watched in 3 minutes. What if someone then says, \u201cyeah, but have you seen the leaked Hillary emails?\u201d What will your response be? You can\u2019t adequately explain the importance of that to your friends in 3 minutes. Instead, you\u2019ll have to send them a lengthy article that they\u2019ll never read. So by the end of this weekend, pretty much everyone in America will have heard the Trump audio, while maybe 10% will take the time to analyze what came out of Wikileaks. There goes your election. \r\nUnderstanding the craziness of the election, I finished the piece with the following. \r\nDespite all of that, I still can\u2019t say with certainty that Hillary will win. However, I do think the landscape has changed enough, that for the first time this entire election season, I am no longer confident of a Trump victory. Then again, I was absolutely convinced that Hillary was unelectable after she collapsed on 9/11 and mislead everyone about her health, and I was wrong about that. That\u2019s how completely crazy this election is, and there\u2019s still a month to go. Anything can happen, particularly with the debate coming up this Sunday. So while it\u2019s certainly not out of the question, there will have to be some very material events over the next month to put Trump back in the driver\u2019s seat. \r\nWhile the Wikileaks emails have been an important factor in keeping this race close, I didn\u2019t think they were sufficient to alter my forecast of a Clinton victory. I think the reopening of the FBI investigation is enough of a black swan to materially change the course of this race. \r\nClinton supporters will read this and think I\u2019m insane. They will think this because they are anticipating a landslide victory for Hillary. I never expected a landslide, so I think this news tips the election into a total tossup situation. My reasoning for the change is the same that led me to switch my forecast to Hillary after the Access Hollywood video was released. The primary reason I initially thought Trump would win related to the fact I believed enough people would be willing to vote for a person they don\u2019t really like in order to blow up the status quo. I felt that the video recording of Trump\u2019s vulgar commentary was enough to put those people into the absentee or third party column, despite millions of Americans looking for an excuse to vote for Trump due to the well understood awfulness of Hillary. This has changed, and voters now have the excuse they needed to vote Trump. \r\nThat reason is simple. The problems with Hillary Clinton will never go away. They will always resurface or new problems will emerge, and it has nothing to do with a \u201cvast rightwing conspiracy\u201d (or Putin). It has to do with her. It has to do with the fact that her and her husband are career crooks, warmongers, and shameless looters of the American public. This re-opening of the FBI investigation just hammers all of that home for everyone. We know what 4 years of Hillary will look like. It\u2019ll be Obama cronyism on steroids, plus endless investigations with a side of World War 3. I don\u2019t think people want that, and so more Americans than the pundits realize will take a gamble on Trump. \r\nAs a caveat, the above forecast assumes this new FBI investigation is not closed before November 8th. If it is, I think she\u2019ll win. If not, I think Trump has even odds to win, if not better. \r\nOf course, with 11 days left in this crazy election, many more black swans could emerge. Stay tuned. \r\nIn Liberty,",
