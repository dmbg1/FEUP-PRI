        "body_en": "United States \u0096 Reformation or Fracture?\nBy Thierry Meyssan Observing the US presidential electoral campaign, Thierry Meyssan analyses the resurgence of an old and weighty conflict of civilisation. Hillary Clinton has just declared that this election is not about programmes, but about the question \u0164Who are the Americans?\u0165. It was not for reasons of his political prgramme that the Republican leaders have withdrawn their support from their candidate, Donald Trump, but because of his personal behaviour. According to Thierry Meyssan, until now, the United States was composed of migrants from different horizons who accepted to submit to the ideology of a particular community . This is the model which is in the process of breaking down, at the risk of shattering the country itself. \" Voltaire \" - During the year of the US electoral campaign that we have just weathered, the rhetoric has profoundly changed, and an unexpected rift has appeared between the two camps. If, in the beginning, the candidates spoke about subjects which were genuinely political (such as the sharing of wealth or national security), today they are mostly talking about sex and money. It is this dialogue, and not the political questions, which has caused the explosion of the Republican party \u0096 whose main leaders have withdrawn their support from their candidate - and which is recomposing the political chess-board, awakening an ancient cleavage of civilisation. On one side, Mrs. Clinton is working to appear politically correct, while on the other, \u0164The Donald\u0165 is blowing the hypocrisy of the ex-\u0164First Lady\u0165 to smithereens.\nOn one side, Hillary Clinton promises male / female equality - although she has never hesitated to attack and defile the women who revealed that they had slept with her husband \u0096 and that she is presenting herself not for her personal qualities, but as the wife of an ex-President, and that she accuses Donald Trump of misogyny because he does not hide his appreciation of the female gender. On the other, Donald Trump denounces the privatisation of the State and the racketing of foreign personalities by the Clinton Foundation to obtain appointments with the State Department \u0096 the creation of ObamaCare not in the interest of citizens, but for the profit of medical insurance companies - and goes as far as to question the honesty of the electoral system.\nI am perfectly aware that the way in which Donald Trump expresses himself may encourage racism, but I do not believe for a second that this question is at the heart of the electoral debate, despite the hype from the pro-Clinton medias. It is not without interest that, during the Lewinsky affair, President Bill Clinton apologised to the Nation and convened a number of preachers to pray for his salvation. But when he was accused of similar misconduct by an audio recording, Donald Trump simply apologised to the people he had upset without making any appeal to members of the clergy. The currrent divide re-awakens the revolt of Catholic, Orthodox and Lutheran values against those of the Calvinists, mainly represented in the USA by the Presbyterians, the Baptists and the Methodists.\nWhile the two candidates were raised in the Puritan tradition (Clinton as a Methodist and Trump as a Presbyterian), Mrs. Clinton has returned to the religion of her father, and participates today in a prayer group composed of the army chiefs of staff, The Family, while Mr. Trump practises a more interior form of spirituality and rarely goes to church. Of course, no-one is locked into the systems in which they were raised, but when people act without thinking, they unconsciously reproduce these systems. The question of the religious environment of the candidates may therefore be important.\nIn order to understand the stakes of this game, we have to go back and look at 17th century England. Oliver Cromwell instigated a military coup d\u0092etat which overthrew King Charles 1st. He wanted to install a Republic, purify the soul of the country, and ordered the decapitation of the ex-sovereign. He created a sectarian r\u00e9gime inspired by the ideas of Calvin, massacred thousands of Irish Papists, and imposed a Puritan way of life. He also created Zionism \u0096 he invited the Jews back to England, and was the first head of state in the world to demand the creation of a Jewish state in Palestine. This bloody episode is known by the name of the \u0164First British Civil War\u0165.\nAfter the monarchy had been reinstated, Cromwell\u0092s Puritans fled from England. They set up in Holland, from where some of them left for the Americas aboard the Mayflower (the \u0164Pilgrim Fathers\u0165), while others founded the Afrikaneer community in South Africa. During the War of Independence in the 18th century United States, we saw a resurgence of the struggle of the Calvinists against the British monarchy, so that in current manuals of British History, it is known as the \u0164Second Civil War\u0165.\nIn the 19th century, the American Civil War opposed the Southern States (mainly inhabited by Catholic colonists) to the North (mostly inhabited by Protestant colonists). The History of the winning side presents this confrontation as a fight for freedom in the face of slavery, which is pure propaganda. The Southern states abolished slavery during the war when they concluded an agreement with the British monarchy). As a result, we once again saw the revolt of the Puritans against the Brititsh throne, which is why some historians speak of the \u0164Third British Civil War\u0165.\nDuring the 20th century, this interior confrontation of British civilisation seemed over and done with, apart from the re-appearance of the Puritans in the United Kingdom with the \u0164non-conformist Christians\u0165 of Prime Minister David Lloyd George. It was they who divided Ireland and agreed to create the \u0164 Jewish national homeland\u0165 in Palestine.\nIn any case, one of Richard Nixon\u0092s advisors, Kevin Philipps, dedicated a voluminous thesis to these civil wars, in which he noted that none of the problems had been solved, and announced a fourth confrontation [ 1 ].\nI have no doubt that Mrs. Clinton will be the next President of the United States, or that if Mr. Trump were to be elected, he would be rapidly eliminated. But over the last few months, we have witnessed a large electoral redistribution within an irreversible demographic evolution. The Puritan-based churches now account for only a quarter of the population, and are swinging towards the Democrat camp. Their model looks like a historical accident. It disappeared in South Africa, and will not be able to survive much longer, either in the United States or in Isra\u00ebl. Beyond the Presidential election, US society will have to evolve rapidly or split once again. In a country where the youth massively rejects the influence of the Puritan preachers, it is no longer possible to displace the question of equality. The Puritans envisage a society where all men are equal, but not equivalent. Lord Cromwell wanted a Republic for the English, but only after he had massacred the Irish Papists. This is how it is at the moment in the United States \u0096 all citizens are equal before the law, but in the name of the same texts, black people are systematically condemned, while attenuating circumstances are found for white people who have committed equivalent crimes. And in the majority of states, a penal condemnation, even for a speeding ticket, is enough to cancel the right to vote. Consequently, white and black people are equal, but in most states, the majority of black people has been legally deprived of its right to vote. The paradigm of this thought, in terms of foreign policy, is the \u0164two-state\u0165 solution in Palestine \u0096 equal, but above all, not equivalent.\nIt is Puritan thinking that led the administrations of preacher Carter, Reagan, Bush (Sr. and Jr. are direct descendants of the Pilgrim Fathers), Clinton and Obama to support Wahhabism, in contradiction to the declared ideals of their countries, and today, to support Daesh.\nA long time ago, the Founding Fathers built communities in Plymouth and Boston which were idealised in the US collective memory. And yet the historians are formal \u0096 they claimed to be creating the \u0164New Isra\u00ebl\u0165, and chose the \u0164Law of Moses\u0165. They did not place the Cross in their temples, but the Tables of the Law. Although they are Christians, they attach more importance to the Jewish scriptures than the Gospel. They oblige their women to veil their faces and re-established corporaI punishment. Thierry Meyssan , French intellectual, founder and chairman of Voltaire Network and the Axis for Peace Conference.

        "body_en": "As of this writing, the increased U.S. troop presence in Eastern Europe includes a battalion-sized element of American troops being emplaced in the Suwalki Gap, Polish territory that borders Lithuania in a 60-mile stretch of corridor. The Russian Defense Ministry announced that 600 Russian and Belarussian airborne troops conducted training exercises in Brest, on the Belorussian-Polish border only a few miles from where the U.S. forces are deploying in Poland. This on the heels of Britain deploying 800 men, tanks, and jets to Estonia, along with pledges of Challenger 2 tanks, APC\u2019s (Armored Personnel Carriers), and drones. Two companies of French and Danish Soldiers will join the British in the deployment to Estonia.\nFor the first time since 1945, Norway has violated its treaty with Russia (then the Soviet Union) not to station foreign troops on its soil. A company of U.S. Marines will soon be stationed for a 6-month deployment in Norway. The situation is heating up in Ukraine, according to a report on fort-russ.com entitled Ukraine Moves Massive Force up to Lugansk Frontline , published October 28, 2016 . The report reveals the Ukrainian Army is deploying 3,500 soldiers and 200 armored vehicles of the 15 th Motorized Infantry Brigade to Krasny Oktyabr in the district of Lugansk in Eastern Ukraine. For the first time in history, Romanian airspace is being patrolled by the RAF (Royal Air Force) of Britain.\nIn addition, the Ukrainian National Guard is deploying a tactical company equipped with 82 mm mortars and AGS-17 auto grenade launchers, along with APC\u2019s and missile launchers. A separate reconnaissance battalion named the \u201cNight Shades,\u201d a nationalist volunteer battalion will be deploying to Lugansk as well. No doubt they will receive a \u201cwarm\u201d reception, as the fighting has been ongoing in the region for more than two years. The area is a severe flashpoint, as the separatists are ethnic Russians of Ukrainian nationality who wish to secede in the manner that Crimea did\u2026Russia annexed them after the popular vote to leave Ukraine. Now (since December 2015) the Congress gave the green light to send weapons and munitions to Ukraine; the \u201choldup\u201d is due to Obama not wanting to jeopardize the election of Hillary Clinton, as the Russians have stated weapons to Ukraine means war with the U.S. and NATO.\nMeanwhile the Varshankya-class stealth subs are deploying into the Black Sea as the Russian fleet is moving toward Syria. The Russian and Syrian armies continue to bomb and attack the al-Nusra/Jabhat Fatah ash-Sham fighters emplaced in the city of Aleppo. The mainstream media, meanwhile, is faltering in its attempt to create a \u201csacred U.S.-coalition crusade\u201d to \u201cfree the city of Mosul,\u201d as the offensive is not working quite as planned. There are also reports that the U.S. government has plans to \u201cnavigate\u201d Islamic terrorists from Mosul into Syria, to cause more problems for Assad and the Russians; the mainstream media is notoriously silent on the collateral damages being caused by the U.S.-led Mosul attacks, in which U.S. aircraft are supporting with bombing missions.\nLet\u2019s be clear on this: The U.S. is beefing up conventional forces of American troops into Eastern Europe and convincing NATO countries to augment these deployments with soldiers and equipment. The Russians have been responding with opposing counter-deployments to offset the U.S.-NATO movements. The aggressive stance is being taken by the U.S.-NATO-IMF hegemony in its military buildup in Eastern Europe and the Baltic States, the very \u201cbackyard\u201d of Russia.\nThe bottom line: the stage is being set to start WWIII on the slightest provocation. \nThe domestic perspective yields that just a few weeks after the ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers) transfer from U.S. control to (basically) the UN on October 1, 2016, the U.S. has had a DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack from hackers on October 21, 2016 affecting the east and west coast of the U.S. as well as Texas and part of Europe. Just one week before, on OCtobr 13, 2016 Obama signed an Executive Order for Space Weather anomalies just \u201cin case\u201d some \u201cspace weather anomaly\u201d were to cripple the power grid and electrical infrastructure of the United States.\nSomething even worse that happened may really tie into this. \nLast week it was reported by the U.S. Army that Major General John Rossi had committed suicide . Rossi had been slated to take over as the Commander of U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command, and the Army Forces Strategic Command. General Rossi was about to complete 33 years of service and was only 55 years old. He was \u201cfound\u201d at Redstone Arsenal, and the Army just ruled it a suicide. The Daily Mail on dailymail.co.uk reported that a U.S. government official told USA Today: \u201cIt seemed that Rossi was overwhelmed by his responsibilities\u201d as a potential reason for his suicide.\nThe problem is, he committed suicide on July 31, 2016\u2026and it\u2019s taken two months for the Army to rule it as being a suicide? \nWith the command assignment, Rossi would have been privy to every procedure and protocol to defend the United States against an ICBM (intercontinental ballistic missile) attack or an EMP (electromagnetic pulse) attack or event . He would know everything from the \u201ctop\u201d down: that is, the Commander-in-Chief (Obama) would have to foster a one-on-one relationship with the man who would hold the key post to defending against a foreign missile attack.\nMaybe this time the missile would not have been foreign, or if it was? It may not have been the leader of a foreign country to direct it against the United States. \nIt is almost impossible to believe that a Major General of the United States Army just receiving a top command post, a 55-year-old soldier\u2026a general officer\u2026with 33 years of service, a wife, and a loving family would \u201coff\u201d himself because of being \u201coverwhelmed by responsibility.\u201d Men such as Rossi (the highest-ranking member of the military to do such a thing) do not shirk responsibility: they meet it, head on. The whole thing stinks of a purge , in the manner that the entire military of the United States has been purged of hundreds of senior General Staff officers, Admiralty, and Senior Noncommissioned Officers\u2026replaced by \u201cyes\u201d men over the course of Obama\u2019s term.\nThe whole thing stinks of an assassination : no suicide note, no real press coverage, and nothing from his friends, family, or fellow soldiers. This occurs, and then Obama signs his Executive Order to \u201cprotect\u201d us from the dreaded space anomaly that will take down our infrastructure. Could this have possibly been a suicide? Think of all of the heartache and grief his family is going through with his loss. What about the benefits and retirement that his family would lose with such an act? If he really committed suicide, then it was probably because he found out about something so heinous, so vile that would occur to the U.S. that he couldn\u2019t live with it and probably couldn\u2019t stop it.\nBottom line: Was he terminated when he wouldn\u2019t go along with a false flag EMP-plan conceived by Obama to take down our grid, cripple our response time, and set the stage for martial law and the suspension of all rights under the Constitution of the United States? \nAs I have mentioned in the past, I repeat once again:\nThe next war will be initiated by an EMP device detonated above the continental United States followed by a limited nuclear exchange and then conventional warfare. \nI never said that it wouldn\u2019t be Obama who initiated the EMP device, and in all probability if he doesn\u2019t initiate it\u2026he\u2019ll either provoke it, allow it, or request it. We haven\u2019t even mentioned the voting (early voting) taking place where fraud is occurring in Maryland, Virginia, Illinois, and Florida, among others. The illusion of the vote: the joke of the year, but the joke is on us.\nAnd Obama is the joker, setting the stage for the transfer of power. That transfer is not going to occur with the losing candidate (in either case) going gently into that good night. The stage is set for a war to begin. The stage is set for a false flag operation to take down our grid. The stage is set to steal the election for Clinton or declare it null and void. Within the next few weeks, the future of the United States will be decided\u2026with or without the consent of the governed.\nJeremiah Johnson is the Nom de plume of a retired Green Beret of the United States Army Special Forces (Airborne).

We haven\u2019t even mentioned the voting (early voting) taking place where fraud is occurring in Maryland, Virginia, Illinois, and Florida, among others. The illusion of the vote: the joke of the year, but the joke is on us. \nAnd Obama is the joker, setting the stage for the transfer of power. That transfer is not going to occur with the losing candidate (in either case) going gently into that good night. The stage is set for a war to begin. The stage is set for a false flag operation to take down our grid. The stage is set to steal the election for Clinton or declare it null and void. Within the next few weeks, the future of the United States will be decided\u2026with or without the consent of the governed.",

        "body_en": "United States \u2013 reformation or fracture? by Thierry Meyssan Observing the US presidential electoral campaign, Thierry Meyssan analyses the resurgence of an old and weighty conflict of civilisation. Hillary Clinton has just declared that this election is not about programmes, but about the question \u00abWho are the Americans?\u00bb. It was not for reasons of his political prgramme that the Republican leaders have withdrawn their support from their candidate, Donald Trump, but because of his personal behaviour. According to Thierry Meyssan, until now, the United States was composed of migrants from different horizons who accepted to submit to the ideology of a particular community . This is the model which is in the process of breaking down, at the risk of shattering the country itself.\nVoltaire Network | Damascus (Syria) | 26 October 2016 fran\u00e7ais Espa\u00f1ol italiano \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 Deutsch Portugu\u00eas \u03b5\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac T\u00fcrk\u00e7e \u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a During the year of the US electoral campaign that we have just weathered, the rhetoric has profoundly changed, and an unexpected rift has appeared between the two camps. If, in the beginning, the candidates spoke about subjects which were genuinely political (such as the sharing of wealth or national security), today they are mostly talking about sex and money. It is this dialogue, and not the political questions, which has caused the explosion of the Republican party \u2013 whose main leaders have withdrawn their support from their candidate - and which is recomposing the political chess-board, awakening an ancient cleavage of civilisation. On one side, Mrs. Clinton is working to appear politically correct, while on the other, \u00abThe Donald\u00bb is blowing the hypocrisy of the ex-\u00abFirst Lady\u00bb to smithereens.\nOn one side, Hillary Clinton promises male / female equality - although she has never hesitated to attack and defile the women who revealed that they had slept with her husband \u2013 and that she is presenting herself not for her personal qualities, but as the wife of an ex-President, and that she accuses Donald Trump of misogyny because he does not hide his appreciation of the female gender. On the other, Donald Trump denounces the privatisation of the State and the racketing of foreign personalities by the Clinton Foundation to obtain appointments with the State Department \u2013 the creation of ObamaCare not in the interest of citizens, but for the profit of medical insurance companies - and goes as far as to question the honesty of the electoral system.\nI am perfectly aware that the way in which Donald Trump expresses himself may encourage racism, but I do not believe for a second that this question is at the heart of the electoral debate, despite the hype from the pro-Clinton medias. It is not without interest that, during the Lewinsky affair, President Bill Clinton apologised to the Nation and convened a number of preachers to pray for his salvation. But when he was accused of similar misconduct by an audio recording, Donald Trump simply apologised to the people he had upset without making any appeal to members of the clergy. The currrent divide re-awakens the revolt of Catholic, Orthodox and Lutheran values against those of the Calvinists, mainly represented in the USA by the Presbyterians, the Baptists and the Methodists.\nWhile the two candidates were raised in the Puritan tradition (Clinton as a Methodist and Trump as a Presbyterian), Mrs. Clinton has returned to the religion of her father, and participates today in a prayer group composed of the army chiefs of staff, The Family, while Mr. Trump practises a more interior form of spirituality and rarely goes to church. Of course, no-one is locked into the systems in which they were raised, but when people act without thinking, they unconsciously reproduce these systems. The question of the religious environment of the candidates may therefore be important.\nIn order to understand the stakes of this game, we have to go back and look at 17th century England. Oliver Cromwell instigated a military coup d\u2019etat which overthrew King Charles 1st. He wanted to install a Republic, purify the soul of the country, and ordered the decapitation of the ex-sovereign. He created a sectarian r\u00e9gime inspired by the ideas of Calvin, massacred thousands of Irish Papists, and imposed a Puritan way of life. He also created Zionism \u2013 he invited the Jews back to England, and was the first head of state in the world to demand the creation of a Jewish state in Palestine. This bloody episode is known by the name of the \u00abFirst British Civil War\u00bb.\nAfter the monarchy had been reinstated, Cromwell\u2019s Puritans fled from England. They set up in Holland, from where some of them left for the Americas aboard the Mayflower (the \u00abPilgrim Fathers\u00bb), while others founded the Afrikaneer community in South Africa. During the War of Independence in the 18th century United States, we saw a resurgence of the struggle of the Calvinists against the British monarchy, so that in current manuals of British History, it is known as the \u00abSecond Civil War\u00bb.\nIn the 19th century, the American Civil War opposed the Southern States (mainly inhabited by Catholic colonists) to the North (mostly inhabited by Protestant colonists). The History of the winning side presents this confrontation as a fight for freedom in the face of slavery, which is pure propaganda. The Southern states abolished slavery during the war when they concluded an agreement with the British monarchy). As a result, we once again saw the revolt of the Puritans against the Brititsh throne, which is why some historians speak of the \u00abThird British Civil War\u00bb.\nDuring the 20th century, this interior confrontation of British civilisation seemed over and done with, apart from the re-appearance of the Puritans in the United Kingdom with the \u00abnon-conformist Christians\u00bb of Prime Minister David Lloyd George. It was they who divided Ireland and agreed to create the \u00ab Jewish national homeland\u00bb in Palestine.\nIn any case, one of Richard Nixon\u2019s advisors, Kevin Philipps, dedicated a voluminous thesis to these civil wars, in which he noted that none of the problems had been solved, and announced a fourth confrontation [ 1 ].\nThe adepts of the Calvinist churches, who for the last 40 years have voted massively for the Republicans, now support the Democrats.\nI have no doubt that Mrs. Clinton will be the next President of the United States, or that if Mr. Trump were to be elected, he would be rapidly eliminated. But over the last few months, we have witnessed a large electoral redistribution within an irreversible demographic evolution. The Puritan-based churches now account for only a quarter of the population, and are swinging towards the Democrat camp. Their model looks like a historical accident. It disappeared in South Africa, and will not be able to survive much longer, either in the United States or in Isra\u00ebl. Beyond the Presidential election, US society will have to evolve rapidly or split once again. In a country where the youth massively rejects the influence of the Puritan preachers, it is no longer possible to displace the question of equality. The Puritans envisage a society where all men are equal, but not equivalent. Lord Cromwell wanted a Republic for the English, but only after he had massacred the Irish Papists. This is how it is at the moment in the United States \u2013 all citizens are equal before the law, but in the name of the same texts, black people are systematically condemned, while attenuating circumstances are found for white people who have committed equivalent crimes. And in the majority of states, a penal condemnation, even for a speeding ticket, is enough to cancel the right to vote. Consequently, white and black people are equal, but in most states, the majority of black people has been legally deprived of its right to vote. The paradigm of this thought, in terms of foreign policy, is the \u00abtwo-state\u00bb solution in Palestine \u2013 equal, but above all, not equivalent.\nIt is Puritan thinking that led the administrations of preacher Carter, Reagan, Bush (Sr. and Jr. are direct descendants of the Pilgrim Fathers), Clinton and Obama to support Wahhabism, in contradiction to the declared ideals of their countries, and today, to support Daesh.\nA long time ago, the Founding Fathers built communities in Plymouth and Boston which were idealised in the US collective memory. And yet the historians are formal \u2013 they claimed to be creating the \u00abNew Isra\u00ebl\u00bb, and chose the \u00abLaw of Moses\u00bb. They did not place the Cross in their temples, but the Tables of the Law. Although they are Christians, they attach more importance to the Jewish scriptures than the Gospel. They oblige their women to veil their faces and re-established corporaI punishment. Thierry Meyssan\nThierry Meyssan Translation\nPete Kimberley",

        "body_en": "United States and its Western allies are to blame for failure of latest ceasefire By President al-Assad:\n SANA \" - Damascus, SANA \u0096 President Bashar al-Assad asserted that the United States and its Western allies are to blame for the failure of latest ceasefire, because terrorism and terrorists are for them a card they want to play on the Syrian arena.\nIn an interview given to the Serbian newspaper Politika, President al-Assad said that Russia is very serious and very determined to continue fighting the terrorists, while the Americans base their politics on a different value as they use the terrorists as a card to play the political game to serve their own interests at the expense of the interests of other countries in the world.\nPresident al-Assad pointed out that Western countries wanted to use the humanitarian mask in order to have an excuse to intervene more in Syria, either militarily or by supporting the terrorists.\nFollowing is the full text of the interview:\nQuestion 1: Mr. President, why has the latest Syria ceasefire failed? Who is to blame for that?\nPresident Assad: Actually, the West, mainly the United States, has made that pressure regarding the ceasefire, and they always ask for ceasefire only when the terrorists are in a bad situation, not for the civilians. And they try to use those ceasefires in order to support the terrorists, bring them logistic support, armament, money, everything, in order to re-attack and to become stronger again. When it didn\u0092t work, they ask the terrorists to make it fail or to start attacking again. So, who\u0092s to blame? It\u0092s the United States and its allies, the Western countries, because for them, terrorists and terrorism are a card they want to play on the Syrian arena, it\u0092s not a value, they\u0092re not against terrorists. For them, supporting the terrorists is a war of attrition against Syria, against Iran, against Russia, that\u0092s how they look at it. That\u0092s why not only this ceasefire; every attempt regarding ceasefire or political moving or political initiative, every failure of these things, the United States was to be blamed.\nQuestion 2: But which country is supporting terrorism? Saudi Arabia? Qatar?\nPresident Assad: Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Turkey\nJournalist: Turkey?\nPresident Assad: Because they came through Turkey with the support of the government, direct support from the government.\nJournalist: Directly?\nPresident Assad: Direct support from the government, of course.\nJournalist: With money or with armament?\nPresident Assad: Let\u0092s say, the endorsement, the greenlight, first. Second, the American coalition, which is called \u0093international coalition,\u0094 which is an American. They could see ISIS using our oil fields and carrying the oil through the barrel trucks to Turkey under their drones\nJournalist: This is the Syrian oil?\nPresident Assad: In Syria, from Syria to Turkey, under the supervision of their satellites and drones, without doing anything, till the Russians intervened and started attacking ISIS convoys and ISIS positions and strongholds. This is where ISIS started to shrink. So, the West gave the greenlight to those countries like Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar, and actually those countries, those governments are puppets; puppets to the West, puppets to the United States, they work as puppets, and the terrorists in Syria are their proxy, the proxy of those countries and proxy of the West and the United States.\nQuestion 3: But money for marketing this oil, who has the money? Turkey?\nPresident Assad: In partnership between ISIS and Turkey. Part of the money goes to ISIS because this is how they can make recruitment and pay salaries to their fighters. That\u0092s why ISIS was growing before the Russian intervention, it was expanding in Syria and in Iraq. And part of the money is going to the Turkish government officials, mainly Erdogan himself and his family.\nJournalist: Erdogan himself?\nPresident Assad: Of course, of course. They were directly involved in this trade with ISIS.\nQuestion 4: Mr. President, do you believe the Russians and Americans can ever agree over Syria? Can Russia and the USA be partners in the war against terrorists in Syria?\nPresident Assad: We hope, but in reality, no, for a simple reason: because the Russians based their politics on values, beside their interest. The values are that they adopt the international law, they fight terrorism, and the interest that if you have terrorists prevailing in our region, that will affect not only our region but Europe, Russia, and the rest of the world. So, the Russians are very serious and very determined to continue fighting the terrorists, while the Americans based their politics on a different value, completely different value, their value is that \u0093we can use the terrorists.\u0094 I mean the Americans, they wanted to use the terrorists as a card to play the political game to serve their own interests at the expense of the interests of other countries in the world.\nQuestion 5: The situation about bombing the Syrian Army near the airport in Deir Ezzor How did the American air attack on the Syrian Army happen? Was it a coincidence or not?\nPresident Assad: It was premeditated attack by the American forces, because ISIS was shrinking because of the Syrian and Russian and Iranian cooperation against ISIS, and because al-Nusra which is Al Qaeda-affiliated group had been defeated in many areas in Syria, so the Americans wanted to undermine the position of the Syrian Army; they attacked our army in Deir Ezzor. It wasn\u0092t by coincidence because the raid continued more than one hour, and they came many times.\nJournalist: One hour?\nPresident Assad: More than one hour. There were many raids by the Americans and their allies against the Syrian position. At the same time, they attacked a very big area; they didn\u0092t attack a building to say \u0093we made a mistake.\u0094 They attacked three big hills, not other groups neighboring these hills, and only ISIS existed in Deir Ezzor. There is no what they called it \u0093moderate opposition.\u0094 So, it was a premeditated attack in order to allow ISIS to take that position, and ISIS attacked those hills, and took those hills right away in less than one hour after the attack.\nJournalist: ISIS attacking Syrian position after American ?\nPresident Assad: Less than one hour, in less than one hour, ISIS attacked those hills. It means that ISIS gathered their forces to attack those hills. How did ISIS know that the Americans would attack that Syrian position? It means they were ready, they were prepared. This is an explicit and stark proof that the Americans are supporting ISIS and using it as a card to change the balance according to their political agenda.\nJournalist: And after that, America said sorry, huh?\nPresident Assad: They said they regret, they didn\u0092t say sorry. [laughs]\nQuestion 6: Mr. President, who is responsible for the attack on the Red Cross convoy near Aleppo, and what weapons were used for the destruction of the Red Cross convoy?\nPresident Assad: Definitely the terrorist groups in Aleppo, because those are the ones who had an interest. When we announced the truce in Aleppo, they refused it. They said \u0093no, we don\u0092t want a truce.\u0094 They refused to have any convoys coming to eastern Aleppo, and that was public, it\u0092s not our propaganda, it\u0092s not our announcement, they announced it. And there was a demonstration by those militants to refuse that convoy. So, they have interest in attacking that convoy, we don\u0092t have. It wasn\u0092t in an area where you have Syrian troops, and at the same time there were no Syrian or Russian airplanes flying in that area anyway. But it was used as part of the propaganda, as part of the narrative against Syria in the West; that we attacked this humanitarian convoy, because the whole war now in Syria, according to the Western propaganda, is taking the shape of humanitarian war. This is the Western mask now; they wanted to use the humanitarian mask in order to have an excuse to intervene more in Syria, and when I say intervene it means militarily or by supporting the terrorists.\nJournalist: This is like the situation in former Yugoslavia, in the war in Yugoslavia, also in the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, in the war in Kosovo, humanitarian problems.\nPresident Assad: It\u0092s a different era, maybe, a different shape, but the same core, what happened in your country, and what\u0092s happening now in our country.\nQuestion 7: And the Western propaganda spoke about the problem of using the chemical weapons and the barrel bombs.\nPresident Assad: The same, to show that you have a black-and-white picture; very very bad guy against very very good guy. It\u0092s like the narrative of George W. Bush during the war on Iraq and on Afghanistan. So, they wanted to use those headlines or those terms in their narrative in order to provoke the emotions of the public opinion in their countries. This is where the public opinion would support them if they wanted to interfere, either directly through military attacks, or through supporting their proxies that are the terrorists in our region.\nQuestion 8: I see the news in the last days, the Amnesty International condemned a terrorist group for using the chlorine, the chemical weapons in Aleppo.\nPresident Assad: In Aleppo, exactly, that happened a few days ago, and actually, regardless of these chemical attacks, we announced yesterday that the terrorists killed during the last three days more than 80 innocent civilians in Aleppo, and wounded more than 300. You don\u0092t read anything about them in the Western mainstream media. You don\u0092t see it, you don\u0092t hear about it, there\u0092s nothing about them. They only single out some pictures and some incidents in the area under the control of the terrorists just to use them for their political agenda in order to condemn and to blame the Syrian government, not because they are worried about the Syrians; they don\u0092t care about our children, or about innocents, and about civilization, about infrastructure. They don\u0092t care about it; they are destroying it. But actually, they only care about using everything that would serve their vested interests.\nQuestion 9: And now, your army you are the supreme commander of Syrian military forces. Your army now has not any chemical weapons?\nPresident Assad: No, we don\u0092t. Since 2013, we gave up our arsenals. Now, no we don\u0092t have. But before that, we have never used it. I mean, when you talk about chemical weapons used by the government, it means you are talking about thousands of casualties in one place in a very short time. We never had this kind of incidents; just allegations in the Western media.\nQuestion 10: Mr. President, when do you think the Syrian war will end?\nPresident Assad: When? I always say less than one year is enough for you to solve your internal problem, because it is not very complicated internally. It\u0092s becoming more complex only when you have more interfering by foreign powers. When those foreign powers leave Syria alone, we can solve it as Syrians in a few months, in less than one year. That\u0092s very simple, we can, but providing that there\u0092s no outside interference. Of course, that looks not realistic, because everybody knows that the United States wanted to undermine the position of Russia as a great power in the world, including in Syria. Saudi Arabia has been looking how to destroy Iran for years now, and Syria could be one of the places where they can achieve that, according to their way of thinking. But if we say that we could achieve that situation where all those foreign powers leave Syria alone, we don\u0092t have a problem in solving our problem.\nHow? First of all, by stopping the support of the terrorists by external countries like the regional ones like Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar, and by the West, of course, mainly the United States. When you stop supporting terrorists in Syria, it won\u0092t be difficult at all to solve our problem.\nQuestion 11: Mr. President, is it true that Syria is the last socialistic country in the Arab world?\nPresident Assad: Today, yes. I don\u0092t know about the future, how is it going to be. We are socialist, but of course not the closed type.\nJournalist: Humane socialism, because your government is supporting the education with the subvention, like the Swedish-type socialism.\nPresident Assad: I don\u0092t know a lot about the Swedish-type, but let\u0092s say that in Syria, we have an open economy, but at the same time we have a strong public sector, and that public sector played a very important role in the resilience of the Syrian society and the government during the war. Without that public sector, the situation would have been much more difficult. So, we\u0092re still socialist, and I think the war proved that the socialism system is very important for any country, taking into consideration that I\u0092m talking about the open socialism, that could allow the freedom of the public sector to play a vital role in building the country.\nQuestion 12: And your big companies this is the state companies or private companies?\nPresident Assad: We have both. But usually in such a situation, the public sector always plays the most important part. As you know, the private sector could feel the danger more and could suffer more and in some areas could quit the whole arena, the economic arena, because of the insecurity. So, that\u0092s why you have to depend in such a situation more on the public sector, but still the private sector in Syria plays a very important part beside the public.\nQuestion 13: And you have very very tolerance atmosphere with other churches, Christians, Muslims, and\nPresident Assad: It\u0092s not tolerance, actually; they are part of this society. Without all different colors of the society \u0096 Christians, Muslims, and the different sects and ethnicities \u0096 you won\u0092t have Syria. So, every Syrian citizen should feel fully free in practicing his rituals, his traditions, his beliefs. He should be free in order to have a stable country. Otherwise you won\u0092t have Syria as a stable country. But I wouldn\u0092t call it tolerance. Tolerance means like we accept something against our will; no, Muslims and Christians lived together for centuries in Syria, and they integrate in their life on daily basis, they don\u0092t live in ghettos.\nQuestion 14: No separate schools for Muslims, for Christians, young people, no?\nPresident Assad: No, no. You have some schools that belong to the church, but they are full of Muslims and vice versa. So, you don\u0092t have, no. We don\u0092t allow any segregation of religions and ethnicities in Syria, that would be very dangerous, but naturally, without the interference of the government, people would like to live with each other in every school, in every place, in every NGO, in the government, that is the natural That\u0092s why Syria is secular by nature, not by the government. The Syrian society has been secular throughout history.\nQuestion 15: And, Mr. President, it\u0092s been one year since Russian air forces took part in the Syrian war, how much has Russia helped you?\nPresident Assad: Let\u0092s talk about the reality. Before the Russian interference, ISIS was expanding, as I said. When they started interfering, ISIS and al-Nusra and the other Al Qaeda affiliated groups started shrinking. So, this is the reality. Why? Of course, because it\u0092s a great power and they have great army and they have great firepower that could support the Syrian Army in its war. The other side of the same story is that when a great country, a great power, like Russia, intervene against the terrorists, in coordination with the troops on the ground, and in our case, it\u0092s the Syrian Army, of course you\u0092re going to achieve concrete results, while if you talk about the American alliance, which is not serious anyway, but at the same time they don\u0092t have allies on the ground, they cannot achieve anything. So, the Russian power was very important beside their political weight on the international arena, in both ways they could change the situation, and they were very important for Syria in defeating the terrorists in different areas on the Syrian arena or battlefield.\nQuestion 16: Is the Syrian society divided by the war today?\nPresident Assad: Actually, it\u0092s more homogenous than before the war. That could be surprising for many observers because the war is a very deep and important lesson for every Syrian. Many Syrians before the war didn\u0092t tell the difference between being fanatic and being extremist, between being extremist and being terrorist. Those borders weren\u0092t clear for many, because of the war, because of the destruction, because of the heavy price that affected every Syrian, many Syrians learned the lesson and now they know that the only way to protect the country and to preserve the country is to be homogenous, to live with each other, to integrate, to accept, to love each other. That\u0092s why I think the effect of the war, in spite of all the bad aspects of any war like this war, but this aspect was positive for the Syrian society. So, I\u0092m not worried about the structure of the Syrian society after the war. I think it\u0092s going to be healthier.\nQuestion 17: And a question about the American presidential elections; who would you like to win in USA presidential elections, Trump or Hillary?\nPresident Assad: I think in most of the world, the debate about this election is who\u0092s better, Clinton is better or Trump. In Syria, the discussion is who\u0092s worse, not who\u0092s better. So, no one of them, I think, would be good for us, let\u0092s say, this is first. Second, from our experience with the American officials and politicians in general, don\u0092t take them at their word, they\u0092re not honest. Whatever they say, don\u0092t believe them. If they say good word or bad word, if they were very aggressive or very peaceful, don\u0092t believe them. It depends on the lobbies, on the influence of different political movements in their country, after the election that\u0092s what is going to define their policy at that time. So, we don\u0092t have to waste our time listening to their rhetoric now. It\u0092s just rubbish. Wait for their policies and see, but we don\u0092t see any good signs that the United States is going to change dramatically its policy toward what\u0092s happening in the world, let\u0092s say, to be fair, or to obey the international law, or to care about the United Nation\u0092s Charter. There\u0092s no sign that we are going to see that in the near future. So, it\u0092s not about who\u0092s going to be President; the difference will be very minimal, each one of them is going to be allowed to leave his own fingerprint, just personal fingerprint, but doesn\u0092t mean change of policies. That\u0092s why we don\u0092t pin our hopes, we don\u0092t waste our time with it.\nQuestion 18: Mr. President, the last question: The relation between Serbia and Syria, do you have any message for people in Serbia?\nPresident Assad: I think we didn\u0092t do what we have to do on both sides in order to make this relation in a better position, before the war. Of course, the war will leave its effects on the relation between every two countries, that would be understandable, but we have to plan for the next time because your country suffered from external aggression that led to the division of Yugoslavia and I think the people are still paying the price of that war. Second, the war in your country has been portrayed in the same way; as a humanitarian war where the West wanted to intervene in order to protect a certain community against the aggressors form the other community. So, many people in the world believe that story, the same in Syria; they use the same mask, the humanitarian mask.\nActually, the West doesn\u0092t care about your people, they don\u0092t care about our people, they don\u0092t care about anyone in this world, they only care about their own vested interest. So, I think we have the same lessons, may be a different area, we are talking about two decades\u0092 difference, maybe different headlines, but actually the content is the same. That\u0092s why I think we need to build more relations in every aspect; cultural, economy, politics, in order to strengthen our position, each country in his region.\nQuestion 19: But Syrian government, you and Syria\u0092s state, supporting Serbia in the problem of the Kosovo?\nPresident Assad: We did, we did, although the Turks wanted to use their influence for Kosovo, in Kosovo\u0092s favor, but we refused. That was before the war, that was seven or eight years ago, and we refused, in spite of the good relation with Turkey at that time. We supported Serbia.\nJournalist: Mr. President, thank you for the interview, thank you for your time.\nPresident Assad: Not at all. Thank you for coming to Damascus.",

        "body_en": "The Far Left Is Planning The Biggest Political Protest In United States History For Inauguration Day   13th, 2016 \nWe have seen very large protests in major cities all over America since Donald   the biggest one of all is being planned for January 20th. Radical leftists are calling for thousands upon thousands of activists to descend upon Washington D.C. on Inauguration Day, and they are planning to disrupt the inauguration festivities as much as they possibly can. And if you doubt that the \u201cNot My President\u201d movement can pull this off, you may want to consider that 25,000 protesters showed up in New York City on Saturday on very short notice. These people are bitter, angry, frustrated and incredibly motivated. At this point they still have more than two months to organize their forces, and many are expecting that this is going to be the most chaotic Inauguration Day in American history. \nOne of the Facebook pages that is attempting to recruit protesters for Inauguration Day is entitled \u201cProtest at the Inauguration: Stand Against Trump, War, Racism and Inequality\u201d. So far, 7,800   that they will be attending on this page alone, and another 26,000 have expressed interest in the protest. The organizers of this particular page are very clear about why they believe that the inauguration of Donald Trump must be protested \u2026 \nDonald Trump is a racist, sexist bigot. We believe that tens of thousands of progressive people will be in the streets on Inauguration Day and in the weeks and months afterward. \nHow one voted on election day is one thing, but even more important is whether we succeed in building a mass movement that can truly change the country, and the world. \nWaiting for the same politicians who led to the rise of Trump to now stop him is a lost cause. \nOn Facebook and Twitter, the hashtag #DisruptJ20 is already generating an immense amount of buzz. This movement appears to be very well funded, and they have already produced some very slick videos promoting the upcoming inauguration protest. #DisruptJ20 : Call for a bold mobilization against the inauguration of Donald #Trump on January 20, 2017 pic.twitter.com/EGU65bOtNG \n\u2014 stimulator (@stimulator) November 11, 2016 \n#DisruptJ20 even has an official website now, and they are openly calling for a national strike on January 20th in addition to the chaos that they plan to cause in Washington\u2026 \nOn January 20th, the day of the Presidential Inauguration, protesters will rally to interrupt Trump\u2019s coronation. You can help organize, and you can attend the march . You can also heed calls to strike , wherever you are in the country. \nOn January 21st, millions of women will converge on Washington DC specifically to oppose the Trump administration\u2019s promised attack on women\u2019s rights and freedoms. Join them. \nAnd on the #DisruptJ20 Facebook page , the organizers are very open about the fact that they plan to bitterly fight against Donald Trump every step of the way\u2026 \nOn Friday, January 20, 2017, Donald Trump will be inaugurated as   call on all people of good conscience to join in disrupting the ceremonies. If Trump is to be inaugurated at all, let it happen behind closed doors, showing the true face of the security state Trump will preside over. It must be made clear to the whole world that the vast majority of people in the United States do not support his presidency or consent to his rule. \nTrump stands for tyranny, greed, and misogyny. He is the champion of neo-nazis and white Nationalists, of the police who kil l the Black, Brown and poor on a daily basis, of racist border agents and sadistic prison guards, of the FBI and NSA who tap your phone and read your email. He is the harbinger of even more climate catastrophe, deportation, discrimination, and endless war. He continues to deny the existence of climate change, in spite of all the evidence, putting the future of the whole human race at stake. The KKK, Vladimir Putin, Golden Dawn, and the Islamic State all cheered his victory. If we let his inauguration go unchallenged, we are opening the door to the future they envision. \nTrump\u2019s success confirms the bankruptcy of representative democracy. Rather than using the democratic process as an alibi for inaction, we must show that no election could legitimize his agenda. Neither the Democrats nor any other political party or politician will save us\u2014they just offer a weaker version of the same thing. If there is going to be positive change in this society, we have to make it ourselves, together, through direct action. \nFrom day one, the Trump presidency will be a disaster. #DisruptJ20 will be the start of the resistance. We must take to the streets and protest, blockade, disrupt, intervene, sit in, walk out, rise up, and make more noise and good trouble than the establishment can bear. The parade must be stopped. We must delegitimize Trump and all he represents. It\u2019s time to defend ourselves, our loved ones, and the world that sustains us as if our lives depend on it\u2014because they do. \nSome have noted that 2017 will be the 100 year anniversary of the communist revolution in Russia, and many on the radical left are now openly using the word \u201crevolution\u201d to describe what they would like to see here in the United States. \nAnd this call to protest Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration appears to have originated with a Marxist politician out in Seattle \u2026 \nA self-avowed Marxist member of the Seattle City Council who is part of the George Soros-funded Occupy Wall Street movement has called for a \u201cmassive protest\u201d   Trump and a \u201cnationwide shut down\u201d on Inauguration Day. \nKshama Sawant went on an anti-Trump rant following the election that stirred up progressives\u2019 emotions against Trump voters, calling them part of \u201ca racist agenda.\u201d \nSawant held a press conference calling for a mass protest in Seattle. That protest was attended by students, members of Seattle\u2019s LGBTQ community, as well as Occupy members and Muslims. \nMany had been hoping that the nationwide protests against Donald Trump would be quieting down by now, but that does not appear to be happening. Instead, they just seem to keep getting more intense. Just check out what took place around the country on Saturday \u2026 \nSeventy-one people were arrested in Portland, Oregon, where crowds threw burning road flares at officers. \nHundreds gathered outside City Hall in Los Angeles to face off against riot police after a daytime march with drew 8,000 people. \nOther rallies took place in Atlanta, Salt Lake City, Washington DC, and Phoenix, as the anti-Trump backlash continued to grow. \nIn Indianapolis, crowds chanted \u2018kill the police\u2019 as they threw rocks at officers in a separate protest. \nAt other times, Barack Obama has stepped in and condemned protests when they have gotten violent. \nSo why is he just sitting back and saying nothing now? \nAs the president of the United States, shouldn\u2019t he be trying to calm everyone down? \nIt is easy to see how the \u201cNot My President\u201d movement could continue to grow and reach a crescendo on January 20th, 2017. \nNormally Inauguration Day is a day of joy and gladness for the nation, but this time around we may see unprecedented scenes of chaos, rioting and violence. \nAt this point, there appears to be no possible way that the entire nation is going to unite behind President Trump, and many are wondering if we are now entering four years of the worst civil unrest that the United States has ever experienced.

Could it be he was actually working behind the scenes to protect and help set up these organizations during his entire presidency? Seems obvious that with the speed and organization with which they have begun marching in the streets since Wednesday the organizations were in place well before the election was held, yes? Almost as if someone deliberately wanted Trump to win to begin the riots acoss the nation! A.S. \nEvery person involved with those riots should be put in prison for life! They are vermin, cockroaches, evil people. I didn\u2019t see republicans or conservatives protesting Obama like this after both of his election wins. I hope this country turns around soon. lg \nGod raises up leaders as he wishes. Apparently, there was a supernatural force behind Mr. Trump victory. At the time when he was prayed for by leading evengalicals God almighty put His hand on him. His saw the humidity in his heart. No matter what the enemy is throwing at him no harm shall come near him. With all the hate that has originated from the west coast toward Mr. Trump has not gone unnoticed by God. I believe a day of reckening will soon scent on the west coast. Brace yourself America. Keep Mr. Trump in your prayers. \ntheir dustructive divisive agenda",

        "body_en": "The Drought That Was Prophesied To Hit The Southern United States Is Now Here   15th, 2016 \nA record-setting drought has gripped the southern United States, but most people have no idea that this drought is the fulfillment of a prophecy that was given four years ago. Back in 2008, John Paul Jackson released a DVD entitled \u201c The Perfect Storm \u201d in which he detailed many of the prophetic events that God showed him would soon come to America. In 2012, he released a video update to \u201cThe Perfect Storm\u201d that you can view on YouTube right here . In that update, he shared a list of future headlines that God had revealed to him over the years. Some of these headlines have already happened since that time, and now we are watching another be fulfilled right in front of our eyes. \nSpecifically, I am referring to this headline: \u201cRecord High Temps Accompany Record Drought Swept South\u201d . \nIn an article entitled \u201c July\u2019s Extreme Heat Breaks Records Across South \u201c, weather.com detailed many of the high temperature records that have been broken in the South in recent months, but in this article I am going to focus on the crippling drought that is plaguing the region. \nIn addition to the headline above, John Paul Jackson was shown several other headlines regarding drought and famine coming to America\u2026 \n\u201cDrought Continues to Cause Prayer to Rise\u201d \n\u201cDemand for Classic Seeds Skyrockets\u201d \n\u201cFood Prices Lead Nation\u2019s Escalating Inflation Woes\u201d \n\u201cSysco and Kraft Consider Guards on Delivery Trucks as Food Nears 40% of the Family Budget\u201d \nAnd of course John Paul Jackson is not the only one that has been shown that these things are coming to this nation. \nThe following is a very small portion of what Terry Bennett was shown in April 2011 \u2026 \nI was also warned, by the appearing of the black horse and its rider, about famine. The angel said, \u201cThere will be a famine of food in your nation!\u201d Not only this, but also the prices of food, particularly grains, will dramatically rise. We will see not only shortages and high prices, but I was shown significant starvation occurring during this time. Death followed this black horse! \nDr. Patricia Green correctly prophesied the election victories of Barack Obama and Donald Trump in advance, and she was also shown that famine is going to hit America \u2026 \n\u201cI\u2019m instructing my children to begin to fill up their storehouses before the famine strikes just as I instructed Joseph while he was in Egypt.\u201d \nWith those prophecies in mind, it is extremely alarming to see what is happening all across the southern portion of the United States right now. According to the U.S. Drought Monitor , most of the southern half of the country is experiencing some level of drought at this moment\u2026 \nThe drought in California has been raging for quite some time, but what has surprised the experts is how dry it has been in the Southeast lately. The following is from an EcoWatch article entitled \u201c Record-Breaking Drought and Wildfires Plague Southeast \u201c\u2026 \nThe atmospheric spigots have been turned off across most of the U.S. over the last several weeks. According to the weekly U.S. Drought Monitor report from Nov. 10, more than 27 percent of the contiguous U.S. has been enveloped by at least moderate drought (categories D1 through D4). This is the largest percentage value in more than a year, since late October 2015 . \nThe upward trend of the last month is worrisome given the outlook for the coming winter: Drier-than-average conditions are projected by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration across the southern half of the contiguous U.S., a frequent outcome during La Ni\u00f1a winters. \nTo say that the drought in the Southeast is severe would be a tremendous understatement. At this point, some cities in the Southeast haven\u2019t seen any measurable rain in about 50 days \u2026 \nNo measurable rain (at least .01 inches) has been tallied at Birmingham\u2019s Shuttlesworth International Airport since Sept. 18, approaching a two-month-long dry streak, topping their previous longest dry streak on record \u2013 52 straight days \u2013 from fall 1924. \nNine minutes of sprinkles Nov. 4 and another bout of sprinkles on Oct. 16 has been the entirety of Birmingham\u2019s rainfall so far this fall. \nAnniston, Alabama, and Rome, Georgia, have dry streaks now approaching 50 days. \nAnd unfortunately, it appears that there is not going to be any substantial rain for the region any time soon \u2026 \nThere are no signs of any significant rainfall through the end of the month across the Southeast, AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Henry Margusity said. \nThe region needs days and weeks of a steady, soaking rain to completely eliminate the drought. \n\u201cThings will only get worse before they get better,\u201d Margusity explained. \nWhenever conditions are this dry, it is inevitable that there will be wildfires. \nRight now more than 100 major wildfires are raging across the Southeast, and some of the worst are in the mountains of North Carolina. \nAs you read this article, more than 1,000 firefighters are battling dozens of large wildfires in the North Carolina mountains. Governor Pat McCrory is referring to these fires as \u201c California wildfires in North Carolina \u201c, and he is not exaggerating one bit. \nIf what we are witnessing is truly the beginning of the fulfillment of what God showed John Paul Jackson, Terry Bennett and Patricia Green, then we should expect drought conditions to continue to intensify in the months ahead. \nAnd as you can see above, they are saying that things will eventually get so bad that famine will strike America. \nMost of us couldn\u2019t imagine something like that ever happening in this nation. But these are men and women of God with very long track records. As I noted above, Dr. Patricia Green correctly prophesied the election victories by Barack Obama and Donald Trump in advance, and John Paul Jackson has a track record of correctly fulfilled prophecies that is exceedingly long. \nAs I end this article, I also want to remind everyone of what God showed Heidi Baker regarding the future of America not too long ago \u2026 \nI saw bread lines, soup kitchens, and I saw people wearing beautiful clothing. Their clothing was not worn out. Now in my nation when people are hungry you can tell. I mean they are in shredded rags. They don\u2019t have shoes or they have flip flops. Most of them [have] no shoes. They are hungry and they know they are hungry. They come for food, not because they are beggars, but because they are hungry. \nThese days a lot of Americans have become complacent and are feeling pretty good about things. \nBut the events that are warned about in this article are coming, and I would encourage everyone to get prepared while they still can.",

Two days before the election the FBI has announced that they are ending their investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s mishandling of classified information. After reviewing the emails that were found on electronic devices owned by Huma Abedin and Anthony Weiner, FBI Director James Comey sent a letter to Congress telling them that \u201cwe have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in July with respect to Secretary Clinton.\u201d That means that there will be no indictment, and the path is now clear for Hillary Clinton to become the next president of the United States on Tuesday unless an election miracle happens. \nThese days it is unusual for a news story to hit me on a deeply emotional level, but this one sure did. When the FBI originally announced that they were renewing this investigation, it gave me a glimmer of hope that there may be a little bit of integrity left in our legal system. \nBut after today\u2019s announcement I have lost all faith in our deeply corrupt system of justice. America has become a lawless nation, and the rule of law is completely dead in this country. \nYes, it is true that those of us in the general public do not know what was contained in those emails, and Director Comey says that nothing significant was found in them \u2026 In a letter to lawmakers, Comey said the FBI is standing by its original findings, made in July, that Clinton should not be prosecuted for her handling of classified information over email as secretary of State. \u201cThe FBI investigative team has been working around the clock to process and review a large volume of emails from a device obtained in connection with an unrelated criminal investigation,\u201d Comey said in the letter. \u201cDuring that process we reviewed all of the communications that were to or from Hillary Clinton while she was secretary of State,\u201d Comey wrote. \u201cBased on our review, we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in July with respect to Secretary Clinton.\u201d \nBut of course the truth is that the FBI already had more than enough to go after Clinton based on what they discovered the first time around. \nIn the world of national security, if you transmit a single classified document via a channel that is unsecured, you will lose your security clearance in a heartbeat and it is quite likely that you will be prosecuted and sent to prison for mishandling classified information. \nIn fact, two different members of the U.S. military were recently convicted for doing precisely that \u2026 Just last month, Bryan Nishimura, a California Naval reservist, was sentenced to two years\u2019 probation and a $7,500 fine after he pleaded guilty to removing classified material and downloading it to a personal electronic device. The FBI found no evidence he planned to distribute the material . Last year, Bronze Star recipient and combat veteran Chief Petty Officer Lyle White pleaded guilty to storing classified documents on a nonsecure hard drive in Virginia. He received a suspended 60-day sentence and a suspended $10,000 fine in return for the plea. White said the information was for training purposes to study and that he had no intent to communicate with anyone . \nNeither of those individuals intended to mishandle classified information, and they certainly never intended to share it. \nBut they were both convicted anyway. \nSo what makes Hillary Clinton any different? \nDuring the initial investigation, the FBI found 113 emails that contained classified information \u2026 Clinton had repeatedly said she did not have any classified emails on her server, but the results of the FBI investigation show that claim was incorrect . Of the tens of thousands of emails investigators reviewed, 113 contained classified information, and three of those had classification markers. FBI Director James Comey has said Clinton should have known that some of the 113 were classified, but others she might have understandably missed. \nAnd I would be willing to bet that the FBI found some more classified emails that they had not seen previously among the 650,000 or so that they reviewed for this renewed investigation. \nBut it doesn\u2019t matter now. Hillary Clinton is free as a bird even though she mishandled 113 classified emails, and it looks like she is going to become the next president of the United States on Tuesday. \nAs a law student and then later as an attorney working in Washington D.C., I got to see just how deeply corrupt our legal system has become. \nBut after today, I don\u2019t see how any American can ever have faith in the rule of law again. \nIf the law does not apply equally to all persons at all times and in all circumstances, we might as well not even have a legal system. \nAt this point, there is only one way that some sort of justice can be achieved in this case. And that is if the American people go to the polls on Tuesday and vote to keep her out of the White House. \nIt won\u2019t be perfect justice of course, but at least it would keep Hillary Clinton from getting what she wants more than anything else in life. \nThe choice before the American people is very simple. Hillary Clinton is the most corrupt politician to ever run for the presidency, and the extremely long laundry list of Clinton scandals and crimes has been well documented over the past three decades. \nThe voters know exactly what they are getting with her. And if they choose her anyway despite all of the things that have been revealed, that means that America is willingly choosing lawlessness. \nTo most conservatives, this election is all about Trump, but I believe that it is far more about Hillary Clinton. \nI am convinced that we are at a pivotal moment in American history, and if the American people willingly choose Hillary Clinton it will be an indication that there is zero hope for the future of this nation. \nSo let us pray for an election miracle, because right now Donald Trump is behind in most national polls and time is running out.",

America has become a lawless nation, and the rule of law is completely dead in this country. \nYes, it is true that those of us in the general public do not know what was contained in those emails, and Director Comey says that nothing significant was found in them \u2026 \nIn a letter to lawmakers, Comey said the FBI is standing by its original findings, made in July, that Clinton should not be prosecuted for her handling of classified information over email as secretary of State. \n\u201cThe FBI investigative team has been working around the clock to process and review a large volume of emails from a device obtained in connection with an unrelated criminal investigation,\u201d Comey said in the letter. \u201cDuring that process we reviewed all of the communications that were to or from Hillary Clinton while she was secretary of State,\u201d Comey wrote. \u201cBased on our review, we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in July with respect to Secretary Clinton.\u201d \nBut of course the truth is that the FBI already had more than enough to go after Clinton based on what they discovered the first time around. \nIn the world of national security, if you transmit a single classified document via a channel that is unsecured, you will lose your security clearance in a heartbeat and it is quite likely that you will be prosecuted and sent to prison for mishandling classified information. \nIn fact, two different members of the U.S. military were recently convicted for doing precisely that \u2026 \nJust last month, Bryan Nishimura, a California Naval reservist, was sentenced to two years\u2019 probation and a $7,500 fine after he pleaded guilty to removing classified material and downloading it to a personal electronic device. The FBI found no evidence he planned to distribute the material . \nLast year, Bronze Star recipient and combat veteran Chief Petty Officer Lyle White pleaded guilty to storing classified documents on a nonsecure hard drive in Virginia. He received a suspended 60-day sentence and a suspended $10,000 fine in return for the plea. White said the information was for training purposes to study and that he had no intent to communicate with anyone . \nNeither of those individuals intended to mishandle classified information, and they certainly never intended to share it. \nBut they were both convicted anyway. \nSo what makes Hillary Clinton any different? \nDuring the initial investigation, the FBI found 113 emails that contained classified information \u2026 \nClinton had repeatedly said she did not have any classified emails on her server, but the results of the FBI investigation show that claim was incorrect . \nOf the tens of thousands of emails investigators reviewed, 113 contained classified information, and three of those had classification markers. FBI Director James Comey has said Clinton should have known that some of the 113 were classified, but others she might have understandably missed. \nAnd I would be willing to bet that the FBI found some more classified emails that they had not seen previously among the 650,000 or so that they reviewed for this renewed investigation. \nBut it doesn\u2019t matter now. Hillary Clinton is free as a bird even though she mishandled 113 classified emails, and it looks like she is going to become the next president of the United States on Tuesday. \nAs a law student and then later as an attorney working in Washington D.C., I got to see just how deeply corrupt our legal system has become. \nBut after today, I don\u2019t see how any American can ever have faith in the rule of law again. \nIf the law does not apply equally to all persons at all times and in all circumstances, we might as well not even have a legal system. \nAt this point, there is only one way that some sort of justice can be achieved in this case. And that is if the American people go to the polls on Tuesday and vote to keep her out of the White House. \nIt won\u2019t be perfect justice of course, but at least it would keep Hillary Clinton from getting what she wants more than anything else in life. \nThe choice before the American people is very simple. Hillary Clinton is the most corrupt politician to ever run for the presidency, and the extremely long laundry list of Clinton scandals and crimes has been well documented over the past three decades. \nThe voters know exactly what they are getting with her. And if they choose her anyway despite all of the things that have been revealed, that means that America is willingly choosing lawlessness. \nTo most conservatives, this election is all about Trump, but I believe that it is far more about Hillary Clinton. \nI am convinced that we are at a pivotal moment in American history, and if the American people willingly choose Hillary Clinton it will be an indication that there is zero hope for the future of this nation. \nSo let us pray for an election miracle, because right now Donald Trump is behind in most national polls and time is running out.",

Mike Adams of Natural News and Dave Hodges of The Common Sense Show have both dug deeply, examining the overall situation with outstanding insights as to the possibilities. Mike\u2019s piece listed the scenarios that can happen regarding either outcome, and government actions that can be triggered by the result. Dave\u2019s videos and telephone conversations expose the fact that the government is indeed preparing to have plans ready and in place with drills and exercises that can turn into an actual operation immediately. \nYou can watch Dave Hodge\u2019s full report with Paul Martin below: \nThat being mentioned, an article came out the other day written by Deb Riechmann of the Associated Press, October 26 entitled US Official: Russia Might Shoot Down US Aircraft in Syria . The article highlights dialogue from a Charlie Rose interview via CBS at the Council of Foreign Relations in New York that was conducted with National Intelligence Director James Clapper . The answers that Clapper gave to the questions gives two \u201cinsights\u201d into the Obama administration\u2019s mindset. This comment came regarding the potential for the US and Russia engaging one another militarily: \n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t put it past them to shoot down an American aircraft if they felt that [it] was threatening to their forces on the ground. Russia has deployed a very advanced and capable air defense system in Syria and would not have done that if it [Russia] wouldn\u2019t use it.\u201d \nJames Clapper \nThen Clapper was questioned about North Korea, and he had this to say: \n\u201c\u2026the U.S. policy of trying to persuade Pyongyang to give up its nuclear weapons is probably futile. Perhaps the only thing the U.S. could get would be limitations on North Korea\u2019s nuclear capabilities. I think the notion of getting the North Koreans to denuclearize is probably a lost cause. They are under siege and they are very paranoid, so the notion of giving up their nuclear capability, whatever it is, is a nonstarter with them.\u201d \nAll of this sounds very lackadaisical, coming from the Director of National Intelligence. That is because it is: Obama is pursuing a laissez-faire policy regarding \u201cthreats,\u201d either from Russia or North Korea. The reason? He created them to use later. Clapper\u2019s next responses are very interesting regarding the questions of whether or not Russia has been tampering with the election process and the recent threat by Vice President Joe Biden that the U.S. will respond to the (alleged) tampering with a Cyberattack designed \u201cto embarrass and humiliate\u201d the Kremlin. Here is an excerpt of that interview: \n\u201cClapper also was asked about the Obama administration\u2019s claim that recent hacking of political sites was orchestrated by top Russian officials. The U.S. response might not come in the form of a reciprocal cyberattack on Russia, Clapper said. \nPressed on the subject, Rose, the interviewer, noted that there is a sense that the Russians were not paying any price for the hacking. \n\u201cMaybe not yet,\u201d Clapper replied. \n\u201cMaybe after the election?\u201d Rose asked. \n\u201cI\u2019m not going to pre-empt,\u201d Clapper said.\u201d \nThere we have it, in the absence of verbal commitment, no matter how nebulous the answer may seem. Just because it is nebulous, however, does not belie the nefarious nature of the answer, and it is obvious: The Obama administration is setting the Russians up for the time of the election to blame any deviance or hacks on them. \nIt is no secret that election fraud is being committed now, even with the early voting that is occurring in several states. The Cyberattacks conducted on Friday, October 21st were a Beta-test for what is to come: full-blown election fraud and an attack on the infrastructure of the U.S. , to be blamed on Russia or North Korea and used as justification to either suspend the elections or declare them null and void. \nOn October 25 , an article was released entitled DMV Computer Outage Raises Fear of Election-Day Cyber Attacks , as presented on losangeles.cbslocal.com . Apparently 100 DMV offices in California had a gigantic computer malfunction that was not attributed to hacking. The article interviewed a USC professor who had the following to say: \n\u201cElection day may be a different story. Government computer systems are vulnerable to cyber attacks. I think there will certainly be some sort of cyber security issue in some location.\u201d \nClifford Neuman, Director, USC Center for Computer Systems Security \nFrom a standpoint of greater simplicity, the government can simply collapse the power grid, and this can be blamed on an EMP (Electromagnetic Pulse) weapon from North Korea or Russia. If this is not done, the government can use the Soros-provided voting machines and other nefarious measures (such as dead people\u2019s names being used to vote, illegal aliens casting a ballot, or people voting in numerous states, to name a few) to steal the votes. Then blame can be shifted to the Russians. \nKeep in mind that the Cyberattack on October 21 was found to \u201cnot be done by a government\u2019s actions through state actors,\u201d as the Mainstream media termed it. How true. Not one concrete shred of justification that Russia has been conducting any Cyberattacks has been provided. Certainly the Russian government has taken the time to investigate the source of the hacking on the U.S. systems. They will certainly monitor the elections in some manner to protect themselves from any accusations of hacking and prove they do not hold any culpability when the Democrats skew the numbers of the election and steal it themselves. \nThis is why the federal government has warned Russia that simply to monitor the elections may warrant criminal charges being brought against the Russian government. \nBut it\u2019s OK to have UN election monitors, which in itself is a violation of the 10 th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, right? \nThe law doesn\u2019t apply to the Democrats; the law only matters as long as they can inflict it upon you. Soros just came out recently and cursed democracy in general: though toad like in appearance and mannerisms, this communist foreigner is responsible for the collapse and/or debilitation of almost a dozen governments. In a previous article we covered how the voting machines in the early voting in Illinois did not register the original choice of the voter and \u201cchose\u201d the Democratic candidates. This was labeled as a \u201ccalibration error,\u201d so simply and innocently. The communists masquerading as Democrats know the truth of the matter, that it is those who count the votes and not the voters who decide the elections. \nIn summary, the U.S. is pre-positioning its \u201cenemy-assets\u201d to blame \u2013 on what the administration does \u2013 for a collapsed election labeled as \u201crigged\u201d or the suspension of the election for any number of reasons, real or illusory, such as a genuine attack the U.S. provokes or an attack the U.S. carries out on itself . \nCivil unrest and/or war are the escape hatches to bail out of the Constitution and to take control of the country\u2026not letting either crisis go to waste. With civil rest or a world war, the administration will be handed the country on a platter \u2013 indefinitely \u2013 and the election will be a moot point, whether it happened or not. \nBuy 2017 Gold Pandas and Buy 2017 Silver Panda Coins On Pre-Sale Now!

        "body_en": "Why Are So Many People Choosing To Leave The United States Permanently?   August 11th, 2013 \nHave things gotten so bad that it is time to leave the United States for good? That is a question that a lot of Americans are dealing with these days, and an increasing number of them are choosing to leave the country of their birth permanently. Some are doing it for tax reasons, some are doing it because they believe the future is brighter elsewhere, and others are doing it because they are very distressed about the direction that America is heading and they don\u2019t see any hope for a turnaround any time soon. Personally, I have several friends and contacts that regard themselves as \u201cpreppers\u201d that have decided that the United States is too far gone to recover. They have moved their families out of the country and they never plan to return. As this nation continues to head down the very troubled road that it is currently on, this trend is probably only going to accelerate even more. \nIn fact, some Americans are even going so far as to renounce their citizenship when they leave. This represents only a small percentage of those that are leaving the country, but as Bloomberg recently reported , the number of Americans that renounced their citizenship in the second quarter of 2013 was six times larger than the number that renounced their citizenship in the second quarter of last year\u2026 \nAmericans renouncing U.S. citizenship surged sixfold in the second quarter from a year earlier as the government prepares to introduce tougher asset-disclosure rules. \nExpatriates giving up their nationality at U.S. embassies climbed to 1,131 in the three months through June from 189 in the year-earlier period, according to Federal Register figures published today. \nRenouncing the country of your birth is not an easy thing to do. From the moment that we come into this world, those of us born in this country are trained to think of ourselves as \u201cAmericans\u201d. The following is an excerpt from a recent article by Simon Black of the Sovereign Man blog \u2026 \nIt doesn\u2019t matter where you\u2019re from\u2013 the United States, Sweden, New Zealand, or Venezuela\u2026 many people all over the world are inculcated from birth with a sense that their country is \u2018better\u2019 than all the others. \nWe grow up with the songs, the flag waving, and the parades until the concept of motherland becomes deeply rooted in our emotional cores. \nNot to mention, when so many of our friends and neighbors unquestionably fall in line, it\u2019s a powerful social reinforcement that only strengthens the bond. \nWe come to view our nationalities rather ironically as a big piece of our core individuality. I am an American. I am a Canadian. I am an Austrian. Instead of\u2013 I am a human being. \nIt has taken decades\u2026 centuries even\u2026 to reach this point. So the fact that more and more people are making the gut-wrenching decision to ditch their US passports is truly a powerful trend. \nTraditionally, the   been some of the most patriotic people on the face of the planet. \nSo why are we now seeing such an increase in the number of people choosing to leave the United States permanently? \nWell, the truth is that there are a whole host of reasons why people are losing faith in this country and are deciding to leave\u2026 \n-The U.S. economy has been steadily declining for many years and that decline now seems to be accelerating. \n-We are being taxed into oblivion . \n-The quality of the jobs in our economy is rapidly declining . \n-Our culture is rapidly going down the toilet . \n-Our health care system has become a complete mess and a giant money making scam . Obamacare is only going to make things even worse . \n-Our politicians are tremendously corrupt, but the same clowns just keep getting sent back to D.C. over and over again. \n-Our nation seems to be on a relentless march toward collectivism . \n-America is rapidly turning into a \u201cBig Brother\u201d police state that is run by control freaks that seem obsessed with watching, tracking, monitoring and controlling virtually everything that we do. \nOf course the list above could go on indefinitely, but hopefully I have made my point. A whole lot of people out there are absolutely horrified as they watch what is happening to America, and leaving the country for good is increasingly being viewed as a potential option by many. \nBut as tempting as \u201c going Galt \u201d may seem, please come up with a good plan first. \nAs one family recently discovered , hopping into a small boat and sailing off into the Pacific Ocean in search of a better life is probably not going to work out too well\u2026 \nA northern Arizona family that was lost at sea for weeks in an ill-fated attempt to leave the U.S. over what they consider government interference in religion will fly back home Sunday. \nHannah Gastonguay, 26, said Saturday that she and her husband \u201cdecided to take a leap of faith and see where God led us\u201d when they took their two small children and her father-in-law and set sail from San Diego for the tiny island nation of Kiribati in May. \nBut just weeks into their journey, the Gastonguays hit a series of storms that damaged their small boat, leaving them adrift for weeks, unable to make progress. They were eventually picked up by a Venezuelan fishing vessel, transferred to a Japanese cargo ship and taken to Chile where they are resting in a hotel in the port city of San Antonio. \nYes, life in America is definitely going to be extremely challenging in the years ahead, but the grass is not always greener on the other side of the planet either. \nThere are a whole host of things to consider before you make a permanent move to another country. The following is an extended excerpt from one of my previous articles \u2026 \n\nThe following are 10 questions to ask yourself before you decide to move to another country\u2026 \nDo You Speak The Language? If Not, How Will You Function? \nIf you do not speak the language of the country that you are moving to, that can create a huge problem. Just going to the store and buying some food will become a challenge. Every interaction that you have with anyone in that society will be strained, and your ability to integrate into the culture around you will be greatly limited. \nHow Will You Make A Living? \nUnless you are independently wealthy, you will need to make money. In a foreign nation, it may be very difficult for you to find a job \u2013 especially one that pays as much as you are accustomed to making in the United States. \nWill You Be Okay Without Your Family And Friends? \nBeing thousands of miles away from all of your family and friends can be extremely difficult. Will you be okay without them? And it can be difficult to survive in a foreign culture without any kind of a support system. Sometimes the people that most successfully move out of the country are those that do it as part of a larger group. \nHave You Factored In Weather Patterns And Geological Instability? \nAs the globe becomes increasingly unstable, weather patterns and natural disasters are going to become a bigger factor in deciding where to live. For example, right now India is suffering through the worst drought that it has experienced in nearly 50 years . It would be very difficult to thrive in the middle of such an environment. \nMany of those that are encouraging people to \u201cescape from America\u201d are pointing to Chile as an ideal place to relocate to. But there are thousands of significant earthquakes in Chile each year, and the entire nation lies directly along the \u201cRing of Fire\u201d which is becoming increasingly unstable. That is something to keep in mind. \nWhat Will You Do For Medical Care? \nIf you or someone in your family had a serious medical problem in the United States, you would know what to do. Yes, our health care system is incredibly messed up , but at least you would know that you could get the care that you needed if an emergency arose. Would the same be true in a foreign nation? \nAre You Moving Into A High Crime Area? \nYes, crime is definitely on the rise in the United States. But in other areas where many preppers are moving to, crime is even worse. Mexico and certain areas of Central America are two examples of this. And in many foreign nations, the police are far more corrupt than they generally are in the United States. \nIn addition, many other nations have far stricter gun laws than the United States does, so your ability to defend your family may be greatly restricted. \nSo will your family truly be safe in the nation that you plan to take them to? \nAre You Prepared For \u201cCulture Shock\u201d? \nMoving to another country can be like moving to a different planet. After all, they don\u2019t call it \u201cculture shock\u201d for nothing. \nIf you do move to another country, you may quickly find that thousands of little things that you once took for granted in the U.S. are now very different. \nAnd there is a very good chance that many of the \u201camenities\u201d that you are accustomed to in the U.S. will not be available in a foreign nation and that your standard of living will go down. \nSo if you are thinking of moving somewhere else, you may want to visit first just to get an idea of what life would be like if you made the move. \nWhat Freedoms and Liberties Will You Lose By Moving? \nYes, our liberties and our freedoms are being rapidly eroded in the United States. But in many other nations around the world things are much worse. You may find that there is no such thing as \u201cfreedom of speech\u201d or \u201cfreedom of religion\u201d in the country that you have decided to move to. \nIs There A Possibility That The Country You Plan To Escape To Could Be Involved In A War At Some Point? \nWe are moving into a time of great geopolitical instability. If you move right into the middle of a future war zone, you might really regret it. If you do plan to move, try to find a country that is likely to avoid war for the foreseeable future. \nWhen The Global Economy Collapses, Will You And Your Family Be Okay For Food? \nWhat good will it be to leave the United States if you and your family run out of food? \nToday, we are on the verge of a major global food crisis. Global food reserves are at their lowest level in nearly 40 years , and shifting global weather patterns are certainly not helping things. \nAnd the global elite are rapidly getting more control over the global food supply. Today, between 75 and 90 percent of all international trade in grain is controlled by just four gigantic multinational food corporations. \n\nLeaving the United States permanently and setting up a new life in another country can be done, but it isn\u2019t for the faint of heart. It takes planning, preparation and lots of hard work. \nHowever, there are lots of people that have done it successfully, including quite a number of people that I know personally. \nIn the end, you have got to make the decision that is right for you and your family. Don\u2019t let anyone else tell you what to do. \nFor many, staying in the United States and preparing for the tough years that are coming is the best choice. For others, getting out   and heading for greener pastures is the right choice. \nWhat about you? \nPlease feel free to share your perspective by posting a comment below\u2026 \nAre These The Last Days Of The U.S. Marine Corps? \u00bb Rodster \nI\u2019m sticking it out. As screwed up as America is i\u2019ll take my chances here. As the article mentioned, when the global economy collapses it may be harder to survive in another country. ian \nno. it will probably be easier, as most other nations dont have gun toting nutjobs and a less self centered view of life. Other countries may adopt a \u201cwe\u2019re all in this together\u2019 mentality, while america will, at first, descends into \u2018me first\u2019 chaos. MeMadMax \nTake ur statement, and make it the opposite, and less hateful, and it would be right. Vindicare \nGuess what, no one is entitled to positive feelings. Hate is a feeling, nothing more. People may hate you, but you live in west, where you must feel good about others, whatever stupid and evil they are. Positive=!good, negative=!bad. And to tell the truth people often earn hate, they own it they. Yes hate may be rightfully earned. Hate is just waste of time, contempt is better, indifference is best. sherpeace \nExactly. The people you hate don\u2019t care! The hate only hurts the hater! So, go for it; Keep on hating. Then you will die young, either from a heart attack or because the object of your hate kills you. Hooray! Now we will be rid of you! (Sorry, I know that is not very peaceful of me, but I couldn\u2019t help it.) Vindicare \nStop projecting. I hate no one but mosquitoes. Usual Yada yada yada! Whatever I may sound to you when I go from keyboard it stop bothering me. Some people write things because they think, not because feel something. This western paranoia is pathetic. FEELINGS, FEWWINGS, FEEL, HURR DURR! Nop prefer logic. condaggitt \nIan most other countries dont have mass quantities of violent black thugs either. xander cross \nMost countries have violent white men with guns. Just look at the white supremacist groups and people like Alex jones. Most white people are racist and evil by nature SVD \nTakes one to know one eh!? xander cross \nYou would know. A racist like yourself is common in the land that you stole from us. Ted \nJust admit that you hate White people\u2026which by definition makes you a racist! Oh the horror There\u2019s nothing worse than racism\u2026oh no sherpeace \nPeople are offended by the white comment, but not the black one. That means YOU are racist. I am white, but I am offended by BOTH comments. You can not make blanket statements about ANY race. It is just unfair and wrong! Graham \nYour last sentence would lead a reader to believe you are of \u201cAmerican Indian\u201d decent. Is that correct? \nIf so, I\u2019m interested in what tribe you are affiliated with, assuming that is something you are happy to share. Joe Jakkerton \nIm American Indian and can tell Xander is African. SVD \nOh you hurt my feelings. I think I\u2019m about to shed a tear. Get over yourself loser! xander cross \nThe loser is the white man that enjoys selling his land to china for a currency that rapidly loosing its value. White men are the problem, that is why they\u2019re marring (or stealing) Asian women in mass droves. sherpeace \nOh, brother, come on! The things that ignorant people say just amazes me! Joe Jakkerton \nThats makes us the WINNERS ha ha ha! DuchessLazy \nWhy do so many Chinese murder their baby girls ? It\u2019s a horror. Jill Ellen Schulze \nyou are really really stupid. You are the reason I want to leave this country. People like you are still kept alive Walt Lonsdale \nWe don\u2019t even know what you are BrianLandon \nright. stole from you, eh? so show us the deed? Joe Jakkerton \nThen move back to Africa and get on with it. Walt Lonsdale \nIS that why there is considerably more black on black crime??Idiot! sherpeace \nIt is because there is considerably more poverty in black neighborhoods. And, I am sorry to say, that has a lot to do with the quality of schools. If you were to check, most successful blacks went to white schools, the only place to get an equal education despite \u201cBrown vs. the board of education\u201d. Son Goku \nMost White AmeriKKKans are psychotic sociopaths. Blacks are on their sick demonic minds 24/7. This article had nothing to do with blacks. If Anglo Americans were so peaceful. Why do they have missile defense systems around China, Russia, and Iran. They are the real thugs. sherpeace \nGot a point there. Just remember that not all of us believe in what our govt. is doing. carnac123 \nSG Because we are smart and we defend ourselves. You\u2026however are just a racist calling others racist. If America was all Anglo or at least all white,.. it would be a paradise. Joe Jakkerton \nWho said we were peaceful? We are violent and always have been. Oline Wright \nNot so, that statement is as racist as saying most blacks are violent thugs. There are good and bad in all peoples and it is high time we stop stereotyping people because of the color of their skin or even the place they grew up. DuchessLazy \nTry living in a an area where the majority is black and see what you get. Mondobeyondo \nViolent white men take over countries with guns. Violent black men take over inner cities with guns. \nWe are ALL under attack!!! Linda Williams \nWho told you that? RalphZiggy \nwhat nonsense you spew, when did Alex Jones ever do or say anything racist? he has even demonstrated against hate groups like the KKK. In the USA, white people huge the majority of weapons but don\u2019t commit most of the crime. You are a white-hating racist, the supremacist full of hate is in your bathroom mirror. xander cross \nDuring the trayvon Martin trail. He and his supporters are indeed racist just like Ron and pans Paul are. His supports are really the same people that go to stormfront site as well. Alex jones never demonstrated against the kkk, but he demonstrated against black people several times. But then again, he gets paid by white men to be an idiot on television so, you defending him proves my point. RalphZiggy \nIt is a fact Alex Jones demostrated against the KKK in Waco Tx in 1999 with a bullhorn, look it up. There are videos of it. You make up an world between your ears and believe in it, without letting facts get in the way of your prejudices Joe Jakkerton \noh man you must be Lacquer head. I bet you love your caurborator cleaner. BrianLandon \nuh right. sort of like the blacks killing blacks in Africa? Or how about Muslims killing Muslims in Pakistan, Syria, Lebanon, etc. And how about the fact that the biggest rate of murders in the US is committed by young black men killing other young black men. \nthe only racist here is yOU! xander cross \nNo, white men are the racist and white men commit the most crimes and they\u2019re not convicted for the murders that they commit. White men commit the most crimes and you use fake percentage numbers to spew your lies about black people. Let\u2019s talk real numbers, not fake percentages that you get from world net daily. DuchessLazy \nLies. Whites actually care about THEIR neighborhoods and gladly get rid of criminals. But\u2026if you\u2019re rich, no matter the skin color, you\u2019re likely to get away with about anything. Joe Jakkerton \nAll colored people are evil and racist. xander cross \nWhite men are evil and racist and to add to your stupidity, you white men turned a third world country to an economic superpower (China). Elliot \n\u201cMost white people are racist and evil by nature\u201d? Are you serious? That is such an ignorant statement with zero credibility. That is a stupid as if I were to say, \u201cThere aren\u2019t any nations in this world governed by black people from top to bottom that dominate on the world stage, therefore all black people are stupid and lazy\u201d. Look at the Chinese and India. They aren\u2019t white, are two of the most populated countries in the world, are HUGE players in our world economy, and yet both pollute the Earth daily like never before seen, and China executes more people annually (with a gun to the back of the head) than any other country worldwide. Yet you tell me they are full of \u201cviolent white men with guns\u201d? You are what is wrong with our society. There are too many dumba$$e$ like you able to post their uneducated, idiotic opinions online and somehow garner steam from it. Some other dumba$$ will read your comment and give it a \u201cthumbs up\u201d without realizing how stupid you both are. The problem with our societies is that the dumb people outnumber the smart ones 100 to 1, and whether you are black, white or rainbow-colored, you are an IDIOT. d \nWhat? Son Goku \nDude!!! Why are you racist bigots obsess with black people?!?! This is one of the reason why people dislike white Americans around the world. Plus you bomb other people\u2019s countries for natural resources. You are the real thugs. Most of You people are obsess with race. Oline Wright \nagain it is not about color or race it is truly more about who or what is in power. ANd frankly as an American I have to say I have not been that satisfied by the government that is supposed to represent me for the last 20 years or so. xander cross \nStop lying because the white people on this site is openly racist. White men are the problem and every white person on this site supported stop and frisk by mayor Bloomberg. mikeymike61 \nneegrows be da prolem, git rid a neegrows and you gots rid a 85% a da krime Tobias Smith \nyou are clearly a racist foolish little boy sherpeace \nOh, EVERYONE, huh? You got a lot of nerve speaking a lie like that! Joe Jakkerton \nHey we only supported stop and frisk of coloreds and gays like you. sherpeace \nLonger than that, for me. Carter was the last true humanitarian in power in this country. Linda Williams \nCarter was an idiot. The interest rate soared under Carter. sherpeace \nWow, you must be one of the most intelligent people on earth to be able to call a man like carter an idiot! Or you are a tea party Republican who hates all Democrats. lunchbox \nfirst of all, tea is delicious, but let me just say that is not a reference to politics, i just like tea. Especially irish breakfast tea. Secondly, you should all take the time to go back to the top of this page and re-read all of your comments. I would be interested to see if anyone can come up with a sensible answer as to how the discussions went from being about the government, and what is wrong with it. Tell me how the conversation shifted from discussing how to solve a very real problem to being concerned with racism, which is and always will be an issue as long as there is mankind. We can solve that problem later, that problem is not what will be destroying ours, or anyone elses country. Please stay focused on the matter at hand, or it will pass you by while you stand idly in oblivion. Mankind is but a petty child, given shoulders with which to carry the weight of the world. So please let us stop being petty, and use those shoulders to lift each other up to a point where we no longer need the guidance of govt.. We are after all the people that they are referencing when they say that govt. is for the people, by the people. Joe Jakkerton \nCarter was and still is an idiot. You sound like one of them Teaophobes. sherpeace \nYou do have a point, but that is a very small minority of white American males. Most of us are peace loving people who lived in mixed neighborhoods and get along with everyone. My husband has been a teacher for 28 years at the same school. Everyone knows where he lives and no one bothers us. Oooops, my hubby isn\u2019t white. Only I am. I guess that explains it, huh? Fed Up With Your Ignorance \nYou\u2019re such an ignorant fool. GOVERNMENTS bomb other countries, and news flash, AMERICA\u2019S PRESIDENT IS BLACK. Have a nice day\u2026 Joe Jakkerton \nOr any other kinds of thugs. Alex \nForget the black thugs. The problem is the scum bag wall street banksters who have destroyed our society while accomulating wealth. Jill Ellen Schulze \nyou serious? You want to leave because of \u201cblack thugs?\u201d. The biggest problem here is the government and in case you haven\u2019t noticed by watching fox news ( i am sure that\u2019s what you watch), most are white besides the pres (luckily!) and they are not the \u201cblack thugs\u201d you speak about. Ray J Cimbalnik \nI agree. Americans will only care about themselves. I can not wait to expatriate OUT of America. America will never recover UNTIL it falls COMPLETELY and then rebuilds. Oline Wright \nI have to disagree. Again it is an oversimplification of the attitudes of the country and a stereotype. Many in the US if they have it to spare will send money to help out countries in crisis due to catastrophic events. People will do so even within the country. It is more a case of the government overreaching its stated powers and becoming diametrically opposed to what the founding fathers envisioned. I have to admit that when a person is struggling to meet the day to day needs of their lives they will frequently become more centrally focused. But I think you will see similar attitudes in other countries as well. sherpeace \nYou said it! Thank you! Boy, thank God when I went to El Salvador in the 80s, they understood that the govt. is NOT the people. I guess they knew because of their F*#@ed up govt. Joe Jakkerton \nWhy not just leave the city? Joe Jakkerton \nI would appreciate it if you just stayed in the USA where you belong. Alex \nI decided to abandon ship. Humans have the right to survive, that has nothing to do with being an American. I am not the property of the USA, although they may think I am. America is not going to change, it is essentially dead with a few exceptions. Once you start disconnecting from this fake American society it will become easier to assimilate to another. In the US we have been spoiled and brainwash that we are number 1 because we have more material possessions then the rest of the world. If this was the case why are the majority of Americans unhappy. Although it is challenging to move to another country, I believe it can be done if one has the will. I left the states about almost 3 months ago and there is not a day that I regret it. Even though I have the advantage of speaking spanish, it still it is a challenge. Even though I may be broke atleast I am free and that you cannot put a price on. Lingram90 \nWhere did u relocate to? T \nYes, but which ones? Can you name them? NoSheDidn\u2019t! \nI agree\u2026no matter where you are, all countries will get hit one way or the other\u2026eventually\u2026especially those developing countries that depend on the 1st world countries\u2026compliments of: globalization! Vindicare \nIt is other way around in case of USA. USA depend on import as it had outsourced the industry. It depends on dollar as reserve currency. And depend on military. sherpeace \nSad, but true. Reality_Seeker \nIt will be harder to survive in another country. Moreover, the global economy is going to collapse; and when it does, it will be open season on amerikans\u2026\u2026.amerikans will be stripped of whatever they have, and in some cases, their lives will be taken, too. Think about your future before you try and run, because you can run but you might not be able to hide. dishatin \nThere with ya nicho12 \nI think it will be harder to survive in America if the global economy collapses. Think about it, America is full of different races all fighting each other to get ahead which creates too much hatred and anger among the races. An economic collapse will lead to a civil war in America and millions of people will die, especially the minorities, the you add in feminism which has caused many men to resent women, you have a multicultural chaos. Most people don\u2019t think about the social problems that America is facing. At least in other countries, their cultures are much more homogeneous and there\u2019s less individualism than in America. In America, it will be it\u2019s every man for himself Mudpie \nI have lived abroad once and loved the nation but I will say living there for good would be hard. When everything and everyone \u2013 including close family, some of whom are ill \u2013 you know is in the U.S.A. There are great places out there, but as Michael notes, money issues are significant as well. Unless seriously loaded, you gotta work. Many nations discriminate against foreigners in the job market. And do not underestimate local connections that you lack, etc. Very hard to accomplish. Of course, most Americans have family forefathers who came from elsewhere and survived. It takes a VERY spiritual outlook to endure the privations until one is comfortable. Also, America discriminates against expatriots and the U.S.A. tax system for foreign earned income is insane and impossible to understand for most people. \nMichael hits the nail on the head when he says the grass is NOT always greener. \nWe may do it again when our children get old enough to live on their own. But for the time being, I think that hunkering down and planning smartly here may be the way to go over time. Travel to those other amazing places. But feather the nest here, live in the state of your dreams and find a city that you are really into. I like New Mexico, for instance, and places therein. Alaska is like a foreign country for the so inclined. \nHonestly, if the U.S. goes to hell then most of the world will go with it, at least S. America and Central America. And at least here your neighbors who are sympathetic to your cause and freedom will be locked and loaded. In many places only bad guys have guns. \nOf course there will be violence here as the Al Sharpton haters pour into the streets. But you will have a chance. \nAnd those liberty lovers in your area . . . .do not forget Americans DO tend to be very smart people. Even in other really great countries, there are even more socialists than here (though some seem to manage it better, for at least a while). Americans who believe in liberty are the best on the planet. \nLet us hope we get a state that secedes and serves as a magnet for free men an women. MeMadMax \nNOT. My wife is from Guatemala, her mom finally got a hot water heater, the place can\u2019t go to hell because there is nothing to break. That is the extreme end of it, but it\u2019s the same thing. The world is not dependent on us for anything, except for one thing: Doing their dirty work for them\u2026. If you think the world thinks about the US all the time, think again. We are like the prissy little cheerleader in highschool who thinks the school would close if she ever stopped going to school\u2026. Mudpie \nDude, I pretty much agree. I like the cheerleader analogy. We are full of ourselves and now it is coming out of our rears\u2026 Dmmonypeny@att.net \nIt is probably best to stay in this country until the riots start. Even then you may want to make your first move out of the cities to a romote easily protected rural farming area. As bad asthe US is, a lot of the world is already in even worse shape. \nAs banks fail and markets crash, you might want to start hunting for another country. I am looking at the Caymen Islands or Balese. \nI am steadily building a supply of gold and silver. I am also starting to take my money steadily out of the markets. I am also taking cash out of the bank. \nThere is really no good reason to leave cash in your account. The highest probability of theft comes from the banks Rodster \nExactly, just look at the conditions of countries like Greece, Spain, Italy, Turkey, Egypt, Portugal, Brazil. These are some of the places experiencing riots and unrest due to economic condition. \nAs things global economy continues to get worse, those places will probably experience more unrest and violence. We haven\u2019t seen it here because our monetary policy is what\u2019s driving the world\u2019s economy. \nSo when the SHTF expect chaos around the world. If you are Jim Rodgers, George Soros or a very wealthy person who can buy protection and a place that can insulate itself from turmoil then it really doesn\u2019t matter where you live. \nThe world has never seen the potential for financial armageddon. So if and when it hits it\u2019s going to be ugly wherever you live. Prophecy2008 \nWhere do you put the cash to be safe if not in the bank? What about Paypal? Sergi William \nI was born in Spain and I am 100% Spanish. I spent 3 months in DC at 2011 and I totally agree with Michael: I had a culture shock. \nAbout the language, even if you know the language of the country you are moving to, it takes many years to get all the slang and to have a correct spelling and knowledge of everything about that country. \nAnd well\u2026 I feel sad because I came back to Spain and I always thought it was a mistake and I should stay in the US. \nBut with the last news and everything, maybe I did the right thing\u2026 \nAnyway, the whole view is so scary\u2026 \nGreetings from Barcelona to everybody! Rodster \nGreetings and yeah it\u2019s tough everywhere you live we cause this collapse is being planned on purpose. It\u2019s better to live within one\u2019s culture. I\u2019m spanish but born and raised in the US. I know even for me it would be hard to move to a latin american country or to Spain. The culture is so different. jacklohman \nMainly the rich will gather their stash and look for a country where it will be protected. But they will have to worry about pirates, or a corrupt security crew, or local politicians who will claim the cash as illegally acquired and confiscate it. Better that they stay in America and fix the system. Gracie Darling \nYou are mostly wrong about that. Most countries in South America and Central America are no pirates or will take you money! \nThe banks in South America have branches in the states. There are actually laws down here! \nEcuador is not less corrupt than the USA. Look around. Look at the shipping docks in the states, for example. Same here though, mostly. \nMoney is pouring into Latin Countries and the government are not taking it from anyone. \nBanks are very strict here in Ecuador. Same in Colombia and Peru. Only two countries are having some banking problems. They are south and in the center of the continent, not Bolivia. \nThe economy in Ecuador is booming and gringos are flooding the cities. Hard to find a cool apartment on the coast. Building is rocketing with huge shopping centers. People are spending money on cars and houses and many luxury items. \nWe have paved streets in Ecuador now! Even toilets and air conditioned bars. How bout that! T \nYou\u2019re saying that the banks there are healthy, and safe? close call \nWould you fix the system that feeds you? It\u2019s a bottom up food chain that\u2019s working upward very quickly. The die off is coming, it\u2019s global. jacklohman \nYea, I guess I\u2019d recognize that I pushed too far. \u201cGreed\u201d is this country\u2019s #1 problem, and our politicians share in it all through campaign cash. ONLY public funding of campaigns will fix it, and ONLY a major turnover in 2014 will do it. \nIgnore the promises. If you are happy with our nation\u2019s direction, vote for incumbents. If not, vote for challengers. MD \nThat is the most defeated mentality on earth. Are you really so bogged down by the system the only thing you can do to protest is vote for challengers? lol. pathetic. jacklohman \nI agree totally dude!!!! lol Pathetic. IF anything, vote independant or no vote at all!!! Jill Ellen Schulze \nNo, america is worse. The pirates are only in africa. What about Europe where I personally know life is nicer and less stressful. Well that depends if material stuff is important of course (most all of the americans I met in my 31yrs abroad where consumed with being matwerialistic or tryng too hard to be destitute losers. I want to leave soon but my [partner is an american and so is our daughter. Although I grew up in Europe I am trapped in the U.S. It is verty hard. I have never found a more superficial, damaging society than here in the U.S Sonia \nI know how you feel\u2026 I\u2019m not European so I can\u2019t escape to Europe, I\u2019m Latin American so I could move back to my country or to another Latin country with low restrictions on immigration. However, it\u2019s very hard, I was brought to the US when I was 13y/o and since then I have always dreamed of leaving this place. Trying to pick a career was very difficult because I also didn\u2019t want to pay 100k on a degree here to move to another country and make significantly less, so I\u2019ve always taken a conservative and safe route and have no debts, but now I\u2019m so unhappy because I\u2019m almost 30 and I still live here, and I\u2019m afraid I will never escape this country. \nIt is really scary because I really don\u2019t have a big family, I don\u2019t know where to go, and I\u2019m scared that I won\u2019t be able to support myself in a different country since I am single and I\u2019m just used to taking care of myself alone in the United States. I don\u2019t have a big family, I really don\u2019t have anyone to welcome me in another country, and I feel really scared. I wish I could find a way to be autonomous, have my own business, or telecommute so that I could finally move. This culture is depressing, and I\u2019ve realized that it\u2019s not just me, because when I talk to other immigrants (Latin, Europeans, etc.) they feel very similar. In fact, after so many years here, my friends are immigrants with the exception of one or two Americans, and even with those American friends I feel like they don\u2019t understand because they still have a blind over their eyes and believe that their country is wonderful. piccadillybabe \nTo go back to your homeland where unemployment is close to 50% does not bode well for America. Best wishes to you. lois752 \nlike Stephanie said I cant believe that people can make $9561 in a few weeks on the internet. did you see this web page w\u00adw\u00adw.K\u00adE\u00adP\u00ad2.c\u00ado\u00adm Mondobeyondo \nHoney \u2013 if you made $9561 in a few weeks on the internet, I sure wouldn\u2019t be posting about it on The Economic Collapse Blog. I\u2019d be off surfing on my private island in Tahiti. \n*burp* \nTell me how is Barcelona? Is it a good place to live? Sergi William \nYes. Good weather. Mountain & beach. In that case it is. The problem is the econOmic crisis, wich is everywhere. BeenThere \n\u201cin many foreign nations, the police are far more corrupt than they generally are in the United States\u201d. I find that hard to believe Max Never the less, I never thought I would see the day when Americans would want to leave their country. MeMadMax \nHey, that corruption can be taken advantage of\u2026 Always keep a $20 dollar bill on you, and you will never go to jail\u2026. \nI experienced that first hand when I lived in Mexico for a while! infocyde \nGood post. Another thing to consider too is that if things go south the natives might look at America as the country to blame for the world being in Chaos. If you stick out in those countries it might be a worse place to be. Just food for thought. Mudpie \nGreat point. I went to a fairly USA-friendly country to live and work for a fairly long period of time and though they liked me, there is definitely a bias against Americans in particular. It is based on the fact that they get lots of stuff from TV and are ignorant as well; and also, honestly, that we really are NOT anymore the nice guys we used to be and they have a reason to dislike us often. MeMadMax \nThe Gastonguays stole my idea! Anyways, I find the idea of leaving the states not only a necessary truth for me and my families\u2019 survival, but an exciting endeavor. I dunno, maybe it\u2019s because I have been exposed to other countries, then look at the US and go, well\u2026 we just suck. We may be \u201crich and powerful\u201d, but we suck at the same time. One time, I was walking down the street of Santiago, and saw a country rich in culture, but not money, but yet, every single person I ran into there seemed\u2026 happy. And you could feel it too. I have also been to lima peru, bahli indonesia, melbourne austrailia, hobart tasmania, and some places in the middle east. Anyways, each time, same deal(with the exception of the middle east) you could feel the attitude there, festive and fun. The feeling I get in the states is disconnected and cold. People don\u2019t want to socialize with each other here. Maybe it\u2019s because of technology overload. People don\u2019t get out of their cars and walk anymore. There\u2019s no street vendors or anything either\u2026 It feels dead here. >_> Mudpie \nLiving abroad was an eye opener for me. I loved the place we were in and truly, now after that America does just suck and seem filled with artificial people and things at this point in history. Seeing from another perspective cemented for me that our culture is vile and we are a moral sewer. Seeing the attack on George Zimmerman was almost more than I could bear. We have turned into a seething cesspool. \nBut again, the grass is always greener and even though America is in bad shape, truly emigrating to another place is pretty radical and not necessarily the solution. Making a community of similar thinking friends here and enjoying the natural beauty of the US (even people in the beautiful place I was in appreciate our natural beauty in the West, e.g.,) may be the best way to go for most. \nBut I salute you : ) And may still join you at some point. \nOne thing for SURE. We all need to become less emotionally connected to the construct of \u201cAmerica\u201d as that was, even 6 years ago. Those days are gone for good. We need to be clear eyed on moving ahead on our principles. \nFor instance, I hear the Star Spangled Banner and scoff these days, for we are no longer the land of the free and home of the brave. \nWhat was true is now a lie. xander cross \nAttack on Zimmerman? He murdered a kid and molested his cousin. Are white people this sick and evil? Mudpie \nYeah, white people are that sick and evil. Sequoia \nYou are probably mixed with white European blood in your ansestry too.About everyone is mixed now days. there are good and evil in every race and nationality and it isn,t fair just to point the finger at one race or people. And about Zimmerman,he is a Hispanic white and Jewish with a black grandfather in Peru.He is mixed. We all need to come together as one people against this evil government that has been hijacked by foreign off shore banks and come together as Americans. Seanyboyo \nZimmerman is not white European in any of his heritage , his father is Ashkenazy Jew not European! His mother is native Peruvian Indian with a black father! I\u2019m white European , my ancestry is traced back 300 years on both sides of may family to N&S Ireland, immigrated to England in the 19th century, my genetic grouping is R1b (like most Western Europeans!) all this makes me white ( the way the above racist zander utilises my ethnicity to place people with no connection to white Europeans amongst us to facilitate his ideological racist hate for white people\u2019s is a classic definition of racist ideology)! Zander & his ilk need to be fought , because should our ethnicity become a minority be holding to zander & co we\u2019ll find no leftist PC defenders, only belligerent intolerance that\u2019ll surpass our worst nightmares! All people deserve ethnic & cultural protection , whites included! Ray J Cimbalnik \nI AGREE!!! You hit the nail on the head! People in all of the other countries that you mentioned might have less money, BUT\u2026they ARE much happier and more friendly people. I have experienced that for myself when I have been in other countries. As a side note, they are also generally healthier than the people in America. I am now in the process of trying to tie up the loose ends so I can expatriate just as SOON as I can. Prophecy2008 \nWhat country do you feel is the best? infocyde \nAlso I have noticed a lot of my expat friends still have their income sources somehow tied to the US (supporting tourism in their new country, online businesses, remote workers). They are proud to have left, but I see this as a giant gaping hole in their strategies. As a temporary solution OK, but if your checks come from the USA or USA/Western tourism if there is a crash you might be very vulnerable. Mudpie \nIt is true. VERY hard to do business overseas unless one is very rich. So many hurdles. Banking customs, rules (though where I lived the banks were MUCH better, real people answered phones politely, GOD I hate what we have become), time zone issues, it is hard to get things done in the states from overseas. Sequoia \nIf someone moves to another country and is dependent on Social Security checks or other income from the USA,will be screwed when the S#!T hits the fan and the USA goes bankrupt completely. If you relocate to another country,keep this in mind, that you will mabey need another source of income. If you move out to another country,now is the time to try to open a business or find some work,because one day those checks are not going to come to you and you will be poor just like in the USA. You need to have a stragety plan before leaving. infocyde \nI will say this though, as much as I love America, I think it will only be harder to get out and we are on a trajectory towards fascism. It won\u2019t get any easier to leave if that is your plan IMHO. This doesn\u2019t mean that you will be successful if you leave, but the option will get harder as time progresses. Another factor to add into the calculus. frankensteingovernment \nAt some point, you begin to realize that the government is simply going to tax you to death. They have no other strategy to cope with the massive debt they have incurred. \nSo these folks are seeing the obvious. It\u2019s going to get a lot worse before it gets better and it\u2019s clear that their US Countrymen are a bunch of apathetic cowards. \nExpatriating is looking very good to me also. MeMadMax \nThere was a post on ZeroHedge of a guy that described the united states as a \u201cPrissy cheerleader who thinks the world revolves around her\u201d. And that if she didn\u2019t show up for school, the place would close down and her friends would commit suicide and the teachers would quit\u2026 well, not quite all that but you get the gist right? Fact of the matter is, the world does not really care about the US\u2026 Neither like nor dislike, they just want to get on with their lives just like the rest of us\u2026 And, \u201cthird world countries\u201d are really not that bad\u2026 They got it all, mostly, too, TV\u2019s, cars, toilets\u2026 etc\u2026. Mudpie \nAgain, I pretty much agree. But you cannot deny that we have a strong tradition of liberty here that many people still carry. Just saying. \nI noticed the same thing about America though Max. And many overseas economies are booming and more free than ours. I even thought China felt more economically vibrant (though I would be afraid to post this over there \u2013 it will be a few years before the NSA starts disappearing people for these kinds of things). davidmpark \nThere\u2019s old wisdom, \u201cA coward is a hero with a wife, kids, and mortgage.\u201d Guess that\u2019s what\u2019s going on here. \nWish we could leave; always wanted to go back to the ancestral homes in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Bristol, Brighton and the small village of Parc in France (where family legend has it we got our name from Charlemagne himself). But my family and I have no choice but to stay put. \nI\u2019d rather fight it out here. I know we have a collapse and an international + civil wars coming and have been studying the possible effects and outcomes, and have come to a conclusion: America is going to be better off long term than the rest of the world. \nMy reasoning is that if Obama or the next president becomes a fascist dictator, they will fail and the United States will collapse. If not a dictator is elected, then the coming perfect storm will get us also. \nMany are leaving for reasoning that they will be better off elsewhere. Not true \u2013 they\u2019ll get into the wars to come anyway; cast into the Benedict Arnold or Coriolanus roles. 2Gary2 \nI think those leaving are sick of the crazy conservatives like paul ryan who takes from the poor and gives to the rich. davidmpark \nDoesn\u2019t Bloomberg have a Bahamas home that he goes to each weekend in taxpayer dime with NYC cops also paid for at NYC expense? vizeet \nI think many countries may be safer than US because US has gun culture which makes it very very unsafe at the time of riots. People may look for more foreigner friendly, having good natural resource and still not heavily industrialized. I can think New Zealand as one. GSOB \nO beautiful for spacAnnotateious skies, For amber waves of grain, For purple mountain majesties God shed his grace on thee And crown thy good with brotherhood From sea to shining sea! \nO beautiful for pilgrim feet Whose stern impassioned stress A thoroughfare of freedom beat Across the wilderness!

It is a hard decision either way. lavista4u \nI\u2019m from Asia. Americans are the most talented people in the world. Its just that they ain\u2019t getting the opportunity they deserve. \nYou are worth more than what America tells you. Just come out of America and see how your value goes up from Zero to Infinity in a day. \nAgree, other countries are a bit struggle too but its not as bad for guys of the caliber of Americans. I admit, I\u2019m not as talented or educated as some Americans who are living in depression and unemployment, but i earn a good income and that has allowed me to travel places. \nFirst, learn a new foreign language, if you can learn at-least one foreign language say Mandarin, Japanese, Korean, Russia, German\u2026The whole world suddenly opens for you. With your English skills and local language\u2026you will be on top of the competitions. There are very few people in non-English speaking countries who would then have the skill-set as you would. \nJust learn a new language. I guarantee you will experience a New World. Joyce J \nI live in Florida, and I keep telling people, if you want to learn something, learn Spanish! I have a feeling it\u2019s going to be needed in the next few decades. I try to do as much traveling as I can. I am not able to do it like I would, but still. I think for some Americans \u2013 we need to learn about the cultures in our OWN back yards as well! You got the Cajuns, Native Americans, and others. Apokalupto Aletheia \nI took Hebrew. I may never meet a Spanish only person, or an Asian language only person. But I will meet God one day. I know I have ticked Him off enough already and He still forgives me. The least I could do is speak His language when I meet Him face to face. sherpeace \nMy brother is being treated like a king in China. They practically have him running the school. Here they made him quit saying he was racist after they put the worst kids from several grades in his class. He speaks Chinese and the children LOVE him; the parents and admin too. HORIZON \nThank you. Ken \nMoved to New Zealand 14 years ago. I haven\u2019t lived in America for almost 20 years now. I can tell you that it takes a significant amount of time to rebuild your life when moving countries. Even though English is the main language here there are a lot of aspects to consider that would be subject to change. With that said there are a lot of advantages living here as opposed to the States. The government is much more accountable and visible to the ordinary citizen, i.e. you can actually bump into a member of Parliament or a government minister on the street\u2026. without them having a phalanx of security guards. There is no oppressive police presence. Only 4.5 million people in a country the size of Japan. Yes it is on the ring-of-fire but nothing is without risk. USKiwi \nWe did the same about 5 years ago and feel that living here is significantly better than the US. Moose is Loose \nI stayed in NZ for about 4 months\u2026 Auckland down halfway through the north island. I loved it as it was a clean and polite country, however viewing it on a map is a bit of a fright. It\u2019s strange, as a born American I must have lived in over 30 of my fifty states including Alaska (but not hawaii), and always on the coast until just recently when I had my first land-locked experience in Indiana, and now living in central canada far away from any ocean. I feel (possibly falsely) so much more secure here. No giant tectonic plates running along my coastlines, no volcanoes nearby to speak of, no oceans to rise over the landmass\u2026 wind usually comes south-east in the northern hemisphere, so our wind current sweeps down from the eastern tip of Russia through the Yukon to us. Not much to speak of as far as population above us\u2026. but when I was in NZ, I FELT the distance from any landmass on the planet. It was like the fresh ocean air, even in the middle of the city, always reminded me that I lived on a tiny blip in a water world. And driving up into the mountains gives you some spectacular views of the waters\u2026 but also a bit scary! to look 290 degrees around you and see the curvature of the earth on the vast oceanic horizon is a big wake up call on just how far out you are! TR \nNo one can escape global warming & NTHE. Ralfine \nAfter all, most Americans descended from immigrants, refugees, slaves. Mudpie \nWhy we were so strong. \nIt takes a tremendous act of courage to emigrate for good. \nAnd back then they did not even have computers or TV to stay in touch with the old country. \nI never cease to be amazed at how low our character has fallen from what it used to be. Pathetic. And happened so quickly. \nThe Left\u2019s cunning is brilliant. Ralfine \nDon\u2019t blame it on the left. \nEmigrants and the left have one thing in common: leaving behind the old and trusted and heading for new opportunities. \nIt is the right that wants to conserve the old and allow very little movement. \nIn chaos theory chaos allows for creativity, while order is stagnation. \nMaking a new country in a new continent does not work with conservatives, you need progressives for that. \nThe only danger is, that even the most progressive become conservative and eventually are left behind when they do not progress themselves. davidmpark \nWhen will the rationing start in the US? Should be before the world war gets hot. Ralfine \nYou mean food stamps? davidmpark \nI was originally thinking of US WWII style rationing. But that\u2019s a good point about the food stamps. With our situation, we had no choice but to go on it. They don\u2019t supply enough for a whole month \u2013 enough for 2 people; not 5. \nFood stamps as the new rationing. Good observation! Melissa McGuire \nI live in Scotland, Great Britain. So I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to live in America. Carl \nAustralia is as racist as the United States mary \nThere are racists everywhere in the world. Where Ive lived in the states, majority of people are not racist. Its a big enough country that youre not on top of each other and people are used to living with people from other areas. Those who are racist, usually have their reasons, often times bad experiences with a few from that race. Most people do not generalize though and see people as individuals. Sounds like you dont, youre in fact \u201cgeneralizing\u201d. Apokalupto Aletheia \nThe problem with Australia for me at least is the Sydney Funnel Web Spider\u2026or the very venomous snakes, or that huge desert. I hate the heat, and most definitely hate \u201cTiny Critters that Kill\u2026for a thousand Alex.\u201d condaggitt \nIf I had $100,000+ in student loans and very little prospects of ever paying it off\u2026i\u2019d move too.,, \nLife in the usa not worth having that over your head for decades. Cubatraveler \nI have not lived in the U.S. in 25 years and I would not go back now. Everything I see has changed for the worse there and I am doing much better out of the U.S. than I ever did in it. If you feel like you don\u2019t belong there anymore, you are probably right and should immigrate. No regrets from me. Manny \nIf things are going to get bad in the United States, maybe they will be as bad anywhere else? Richard \nWhy has my comment been deleted three times this morning? chris \nSinking ship? Not that i\u2019m saying the people leaving are rats of course! Rufus T Firefly \nThe quicker these ignorant religious wackos leave the country, the better off we will be. Maria S Biddle \nAs flawed as she is, this is home and I will fight for her, not flee. xander cross \nYeah right. You will work for the Chinese and then complain about the very jobs your white male CEO\u2019s sold to them in the first place. Smithfield, va comes to mind. mary \nShe should complain, as should we all. We help bring more of them to middle class, while we hurt ourselves. Glad to see they are doing better but not at our own expense. I personally know several Companies affiliated with China, and if they left and brought the jobs back home, a lot of our current issues would be solved. And not just in China either. If our own Companies cant be loyal to the US, I dont support them. I understand the situation for some of them(shipping costs etc) or reduced labor costs helped their survival, but the government should be doing more to bring them back with incentives. The rest of us need to get innovative and help create more jobs. This country has survived issues before, they will rise above them again. Negativity defeats us. Positive attitudes with hard work and creativity can save us and help us to rise above our problems. Unify ourselves and create jobs so that families can remain in the same cities, we need to revitalize our family situations and our Communities to reach out to one another. Its up to all of us as individuals. If you see defeat and dont make an effort, then youre going down with the ship. I would rather try to save it. We can all be leaders, and we need strong, energetic leaders to encourage us with communication\u2026speak to us as a nation, revitalize us with their spirit and leadership. A leadership which calls on those in the country to take us down the right paths to renew the economy and rebuild the nation. Jackie Milton \nI personally support going galt. Become less productive on purpose. Do not earn anymore than it takes to survive.Keep yourself under the poverty level. Do not enable the government to extort more taxes by working harder and being more productive than others. If people will study the history of the past 40 yrs and the paradigm of today they will find that it is not beneficial to be extremely productive in our society. sherpeace \nYou can blame that on laws passed by Republicans to give welfare to corporations and leave nothing for the middle class. TA \nWelfare is wrong no matter who the recipient. It is the initiation of force that provides the welfare state. seth datta \nI don\u2019t know what the future holds, but there is the potential for social cataclysm in many parts of the world. I don\u2019t think the UK will survive as we have too many people compared to local resources; we only survive because of fraudulent banking practices of the City of London Corporation. \nSeems the better English-speaking countries are Canada, Australia and New Zealand. If you add Germany, Chile and Singapore to this list, you have the best countries for white people to live in future. For non-Caucasians, mostly these countries or a few extra ones may be fine, depending. The US and ireland are both fence-sitters, as the administration of the US is enslaving the world and the US through enforced globalisation practices designed to make the rich more wealthy. So it could go either way. \nI do believe the US stood for something that no other nation achieved, and that this is something worth fighting for. markthetruth \nIn the end you will most likely survive in a place you grew up in and are familiar with. And I\u2019m a believer you are where you are for a reason. Stay Put ! Like all living things they learn how to adapt. \nthe end\u2026 K \nIf I had very young children. I might feel I owed it to them to leave. But since I do not, I will stay. All of us have the choice to run, or take a stand. Running always seems easier, so many do it. As the encroaching darkness of Fascism spreads throughout this Country. I will continue to hold up my small light in the darkness. And if one day they come and snuff out that light, so be it. Some times taking a stand for the right thing, is the only action a decent person has left. piccadillybabe \nAmerica is resilient. We bounce back because most of us carry that \u201csmall light in the darkness\u201d and ride out the storms and carry \u201chope\u201d in our hearts. It\u2019s just hard to see all the insanity and chaos going on now days and all for what? It\u2019s gotten so out of control. Jade \nI have had the same thought, but likely I grow tired of being a Delphi that no one listens too even though the evidence is laid out in front of them. T \nAmen. Couldn\u2019t have said it better. I\u2019m going to make a stand, and fight in my own small way. JailBanksters \nBut the only ones leaving are the ones that helped to create the problems. And their the only ones that doesn\u2019t matter where they move to. It\u2019s not like they contributed a lot to society, you would probably be better off without them to be honest. It would be a totally different story if all the Peasants left leaving all the rich behind. Vlad Lenin \nIf it was a pure economic collapse, we would stay. But, it won\u2019t be. This country is headed towards a future that would make Adolf Hitler proud. When the collapse comes, the people in power will use that as an opportunity to go all in. Many of us will be imprisoned (or just disappear), there will be confiscation on a national scale\u2026 we\u2019re going to loose everything we have, so why not leave now while we still have something. Look at Lincoln and FDR, they\u2019re already done stuff like this. Americans are bred to be fascist lites (we call the American system). When the end comes and the majority side with the government, what are you going to do? \nAnd no it\u2019s not just the rich leaving. Our group is all middle class professionals\u2026tired of being handed our cards. And yes I said group, we have found ways to nullify or attenuate the article\u2019s valid points. There is a way. \nThis country just isn\u2019t worth the trouble anymore. Mudpie \nGood points here as well. \nPeople disappeared in Argentina. And Mexico. And in many other places. The USA was unique. Not so much anymore. Jim \nI am a dual citizen, living outside the US. At the moment I am seriously considering giving up my US citizenship due to the cost to keep it. Very few who live in the US realize (and not all expats) the paper work required to live outside the US and hold either a green card or citizenship. I certainly don\u2019t have much and the cost in time is huge and a mistakes (not intentional avoidance, mistakes) can cost a large part of the account plus tax penalties. The cost is also professional, if I have too much authority at my company I have to report various aspects of the company to the IRS. The report has to be made even if it breaks the law of country the company is based in. It is becomning inpossible to open or maintain a forgien bank account in many countries if one is a US citizen as the banks don\u2019t want to deal with the IRS and the penalties. US citizenship simple isn\u2019t worth the cost to me. Mudpie \nWe almost reached that point. \nYou are so right about the paperwork. robert burns \nI would not define \u201cmany\u201d the same way as if there is a mass migration. There isn\u2019t and won\u2019t be. First, it requires money. Second, it requires skills. Third, it requires another country willing to take you for either your money or your skills. It is difficult and time consuming. People who have done it struggle usually and some come back because they cannot bear not being \u201cnear\u201d family. Even with Skype it is hard to remain abroad without huge commitment. Far more people are trying to get into the US. Many are losers such as from Mexico but there are many, many well educated ones from mainland China and India. They still view this as a land of opportunity compared to their home countries. Even if I could get into one of the chosen countries: NZ, Australia or Canada, I would not do it at this stage of life (age 67). Not enough energy for it and unwilling to be away from children. I tend to think more along the lines of a favorite Vietnam related song: NOWHERE TO RUN TO. Jodi \nI think the best plan is to be prepared. As nice as it sounds to move away from it all, it would be difficult to adjust. Charlie \nWhat if the citizen\u2019s of the countries that people are running to for whatever reason begin to hate Americans. These peoples lives could be in serious jeopardy. jakartaman \nI have lived in several countries. America has gone to the dogs and the whole world will be at war over basic resources. Why did America become so powerful? Two Oceans Freedom Once the SFTF there will be a scramble for \u201cThings\u201d There will be a lot of death from violence, starvation, thirst, disease etc. even possible nuclear? Once things settle down to a reasonable level people will reconstitute themselves and their living environments \u2013 It will be like the 1850\u2019s. Where would you rather be at this time \u2013 I want to be in America where there is a lot of natural resources. Belize \u2013 really \u2013 the coconuts will run out soon! David Kessel \nAnother important thing- if not \u2018the\u2019 most important thing to consider is visas. You will relocate as what? Most countries either want a special skill or money from you. Otherwise, you\u2019re a tourist with no rights whatsoever and your tourist visa may or may not be extended. And also, most countries protect their job market from foreigners. Even if you have a skill, they just may not want to hire you. The exception is maybe teaching English for a pittance. Ralfine \nAnd you need to be married to take your sweetheart with you. Some people are not even allowed to marry everywhere or their marriages are not recognised as such. \nYour children might not have the right to stay after they turn 18, if they have neither a job nor citizenship. David Kessel \nIf you are both 1st world citizens, you don\u2019t need to be married. If you are a 1st world citizen and/or your sweetheart is say a Filipina, then you will have to be married but still the immigration may not grant her a tourist visa. Ralfine \nAnd if we are both boys, \u2026 David Kessel \nThat is even worse. That is why any article about resettling must touch upon the visa issue by country as the first topic, not culture shock-shmulture shock, The next thing is how and where to make a living- work permits, etc. Then, and only then come other relatively minor things described above. Ralfine \nYes, culture shock is something you can worry about, when you have the permission to live (and work) there together. \nAnd language? Well, just learn it. Richard \nThat makes four times my comment has been deleted. I wold like to know why. Ralfine \nLeft my home 20 years ago for a job in China. It was a culture shock. No living in England. Another culture shock. \nJust one regret: I didn\u2019t learn Chinese. ArigatouGozaimas \nSwitching countries is mainly an option for the very wealthy. And for those who are not wealthy, where do they go? \nCanada might become an option in the future. they have more solid fundamentals to their economy, a wealth of resources, and their socialized medical system will function better than Obama care. \nIn the U.S. itself there is a large diversity between regions. So most of the migration might actually be within the U.S. and not require renunciation of citizenship. I could envision a movement of population to the energy producing regions of the U.S. (Texas & North Dakota). \nPerhaps migration to the Midwest could become international at some point in the future. If there is a state and municipal debt crisis and New York, California, and Illinois need federal bailouts will the energy producing states stay in the Union and fork over the money to save them? \nImagine the U.S. in three parts. The west coast, the north east coast, and the middle/south. I think it is a possibility. There is nothing unifying the american people beyond a bloated government making an overabundance of rules and passing out the common currency as it sees fit. (redistribution of wealth) apeiron \nNot that I endorse emigration, but might I suggest Uruguay. Climate like coastal Georgia, constitutional republic with sane laws, less than 5% unemployment, about 3 1/2 million population half of which live in Montevideo, fertile well watered, 93% of the population is of European extraction, mostly catholic\u2026no Muslims. Montevideo is a short distance from Buenos Aries. But, of course, Spanish is the predominate language. El Pollo de Oro \nApeiron: If I moved to Latin America, Uruguay would be at the top of my list along with Chile. I\u2019ve known Italians and Spaniards who felt right at home in Monteovideo or Santiago and felt like they had never left Europe. And those cities are relatively safe (certainly compared to Caracas or Guatemala City). \nPero si un estadounidense no hable espa\u00f1ol, no recomiendo mudarse a Uruguay o Chile. Si un americano no tiene ganas de hablar espa\u00f1ol, es mejor quedarse en un pa\u00eds ingleshablante. NoSheDidn\u2019t! \nHave you ever read the book \u201cHow to hide your assets and disappear\u201d by Edmund Pankau? It\u2019s a bit outdated but the book has many low tech tips and tricks that come in handy. I guess it would be a \u201cstarter\u201d book to get into that topic. I was born and raised in Mexico city, learned English at a bilingual private British school\u2026boy was it a shock when i moved to the US! For starters the accents, like the southern one, the NY one, the Boston one\u2026golly! Been living in the USA for 10 years now, i picked up the slang pretty quick but am still baffled by the accents. People looked at me weird when i said the words \u201cpetrol\u201d, \u201cbanister\u201d, \u201ccupboard\u201d, \u201clift\u201d, \u201cstorey\u201d. People also looked at me weird when i wrote words like \u201ccolour\u201d, \u201cneighbour\u201d, \u201clearned\u201d. I\u2019ll never forget their faces when they heard me say \u201ci have to collect my husband\u201d\u2026lol\u2026 :b they probably thought i was fixin\u2019 (southern term) to charge him for child support or smthg xD\u2026I also got fat, because i fell in love with \u201cMiami subs\u201d, their hush puppies, milkshakes and deep fried fish were delicious\u2026country fried steak with gravy, biscuits and gravy every morning\u2026oy! chicken tenders with honey mustard\u2026ran to Mickey D\u2019s or Taco Bell for a snack, i put ranch on just about everything i ate and the biggest change of all: I HAD A CAR! shoot, back in Mex city i walked everywhere, never needed a car, had the subway, buses, cabs, etc. So between the foods i was eating and having a car i literally ballooned, fast\u2026like 100 lbs in a year. It took me a while to lose the weight and get back to exercising but i finally lost the extra lbs. Talk about a culture shock!

Hopefully this country will have learned that putting spoiled rotten-to-the-core race baiting entitlement demanding free market hating socialist/progressive/Marxist Muslims in any position of power is not the road you want to go down. Muhammad Kazim \n\u201cAb tau ghabra kai yeh kehtai hein keh mar jaaein gai Mar kai bhi chain nah paya tau kidhar jaaein gai\u201d \n(A very famous couplet in Urdu) \nTranslation: Feeling nervous about this world, in panic I console myself saying I would die. But even if death too doesn\u2019t provide the desired peace of mind, where would I go? \nStick to the land of opportunities and hope for the best; keep your composure. Ready to Bail \nLeaving the US is a very viable option and not nearly as difficult as some might think. I am set to leave whenever it I deem it appropriate. I own several pieces if property / housing in another country, have bank accounts / credit cards already in place, a successful business in place and Permanent Residency in the country of my choice ( won\u2019t be identified ). Leave your arrogance and sense of entitlement at the border. Learn the language and don\u2019t complain about how they do things.. you are there voluntarily. And no, I am not rich. Wherever you think is viable, go there. Spend lot\u2019s of time there. Go back again and again if you can\u2019t spend extended time there. MAKE LOCAL FRIENDS.. real ones.. not ones who think you are a rich American. Be NICE. Always. Smiles remove more obstacles than arguments. 68Impala \n1,139 out of 319,000,000 or looking at it another way 99.99964% are staying. How many of the 1,139 are born here, didn\u2019t marry a spouse from another country or left for a tax haven. Things are going downhill but I do not believe the 1,139 are the canaries in the coal mine. chris \nYou\u2019ve not understood. That\u2019s 1,139 who have RENOUNCED their citizenship on leaving. That number is only a tiny fraction of those that left. Richard \nLet\u2019s see: The following are 10 questions to ask yourself before you decide to move to another country\u2026 Do You Speak The Language? If Not, How Will You Function? There are plenty of countries where you can get by in English \u2013 even where English is not the main language (e.g. India. Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Philippines, etc. etc.) Richard \nLet\u2019s see: The following are 10 questions to ask yourself before you decide to move to another country\u2026 Do You Speak The Language? If Not, How Will You Function? There are plenty of countries where you can get by in English \u2013 even where English is not the main language (e.g. India. Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Philippines, etc. etc.) How Will You Make A Living? Teach English As A Foreign Language. Google TOEFL. Countries like Thailand, Korea and Malaysia are CRYING OUT for English teachers and YOU DO NOT NEED ANY EXPERIENCE. Just the fact of being able to speak English fluently is often enough. It need not at all be \u201cvery difficult to find a job\u201d. Sorry, that is not an excuse. Will You Be Okay Without Your Family And Friends? Yes, make new ones. And you will probably speak more to your family abroad than you did when living near them. (Skype and Magicjack, for example, offer FREE phone calls anywhere in the States from anywhere in the world. Sorry, excuse just vanished. Joyce J \nI\u2019m finishing up my degree in technical writing, and they are looking for people all over places in Latin America to teach English. TESOL certifications aren\u2019t very hard to get (if indeed you need one). It doesn\u2019t pay a lot but (depending on the country) it\u2019s a pretty decent salary. Some require you only be a native English speaker. Some are for public schools, some private. Just depends. And if you can speak both English and Spanish (which I only know enough to get by), it\u2019s better. I seriously thought about doing it. Richard \nHave You Factored In Weather Patterns And Geological Instability? Hmmm\u2026 ask that question of those who live in Florida, California, the mid-west.. Need I say more? Oh, sorry drought??? DROUGHT?? Oh please. Give me a break! What Will You Do For Medical Care? Pay less than a tenth of what you pay in the States. Next question? Oh sorry, \u201cget the care you needed (in the States)\u201d Are you trying to make me laugh? American doctors are among the most careless, ignorant, greedy, distasteful professionals in the world. In my 22 years in the United States I can regale you with stories that would turn your hair. More people die of medical malpractice in the United States of Stupidity than anywhere else in the world. Are You Moving Into A High Crime Area? Then don\u2019t. Whatever the above statement is, it is NOT a reason not to stay in the (crime-ridden) United States. Richard \nAre You Prepared For \u201cCulture Shock\u201d? If you haven\u2019t already suffered \u201cculture shock\u201d from living in the United States in recent years, you won\u2019t notice it anywhere else either. If you do move to another country, you may quickly find that thousands of little things that you once took for granted in the U.S. are now very different. And there is a very good chance that many of the \u201camenities\u201d that you are accustomed to in the U.S. will not be available in a foreign nation and that your standard of living will go down. True. And if your standard of living hasn\u2019t already \u201cgone down\u201d in recent times while living in the United States, you are very lucky. What Freedoms and Liberties Will You Lose By Moving? Yes, our liberties and our freedoms are being rapidly eroded in the United States. But in many other nations around the world things are much worse. You may find that there is no such thing as \u201cfreedom of speech\u201d or \u201cfreedom of religion\u201d in the country that you have decided to move to. Nobody is suggesting moving to such countries. This is a silly comment designed to dissuade you from leaving the United States. Michael, I am sure you are quite shocked to see from the Comments how many people agree with the idea of leaving. Probably not what you hoped to see. sherpeace \nI experienced culture shock years ago moving from Upstate New York to New Orleans, LA. It was worse than any culture shock going to any other country, including El Salvador in the 80s when it was embroiled in civil war! Dubaibonddude \nIts not easy anywhere. Agreed. But catastrophe is everywhere from Cyprus to Greece and Spain to Syria and Egypt. Sanctions on Iran\u2026etc. \nWithout a job and income, most are doomed, anyways, wherever they live. \nRich, who are people with above USD 1m in net worth and number about 25m (0.35% of World pop.) and people with over USD 100k are 334m out of 7bn which is just 4.77% so approx 5% have USD 100k and more. \nWhat about the remainder 95% who do not even have access to a computer, and in most cases to food and water? They have no clue what a financial crisis means! I do not think they are thinking giving up any citizenships or moving abroad. They dont even have a dollar to eat a square meal or a bus fare. They are not reading any internet articles, too. \nOnly 5% of the planet, at most, will be and is worried but the remainder from the jungles of Amazon to the Savannahs of Africa or interiors of China and India will make it through just fine, unless someone takes away their money and job,\u2026but hey they never had one in the first place! \nThis was more tongue in cheek but does anyone care to comment? El Pollo de Oro \nIt isn\u2019t hard to see why someone would want to get the hell out of The Banana Republic of America, formerly Gli Stati Uniti. From the shortage of decent jobs to the death of the American middle class to an increasingly abusive police state to an abomination of a health care system, the reasons to leave this collapsing hellhole are numerous. This banana republic is not the America I grew up in. But if you\u2019re going to leave, there is much to consider. I know some American expatriates who really enjoy living overseas and have no desire to return to the BRA, but other Americans would be absolutely miserable in another country. It depends on the individual. \nIf you\u2019re the type of person who enjoys speaking more than one language and has a sense of adventure, you might do really well as an expatriate. I\u2019ve known Americans who spoke perfect French and fit right in when they moved to France or Belgium. \nOn the other hand, if you\u2019re the type of American who makes a beeline for McDonalds the minute you get to Amsterdam or gets upset because someone in Rome spoke to you in Italian\u2026\u2026you won\u2019t make a very good expatriate. \nSo again, it depends on the individual. El Pollo de Oro \nIf you do stay: remember that our once-great country is now a banana republic, and the misery will only get worse for the vast majority of Americans. Below, some savvy individuals express the gravity of the situation, and smart people will heed their warnings. \n\u201cOur country\u2019s vital signs are tanking\u2014not just from the monetary area, but from a liberty standpoint as well.

They walk around like they\u2019re zombines. They are dying. If you look at the life expectancy from 1990 until now of somebody without a high school educiation in America, the life expectancy has dropped 5 years for women and 3 years for men. The Great Depression has been where I live for years. You have everybody eeking along on social security or disability. The food is poisoning them.

ArigatouGozaimas \nFor English speakers there is Canada, The United Kingdom, Ireland, South Africa, Kenya, Belize, New Zealand and Australia for starters. TrailerParkOverpriced \nI have a friend who is moving to the Atlantic provinces since it is away from it all\u2026.the person lived in Toronto for 20 years and like many other residents, the immigration, cheap foreign labour programme, youth unemployment and crimes committed by youth and expensive housing is making Toronto a future Chicago where there is a few haves and lots of have-nots who can\u2019t get a chance to get out of poverty legally. ArigatouGozaimas \nI wonder where the immigrants into Toronto are coming from? \nIt\u2019s sad to hear that. My most powerful picture of Canada was comparing Detroit to Windsor on Google Maps. The difference is astonishing. \nThough Canada is really not that much different than the U.S. politically and economically. Though it seems the version of socialism to the north is less corrupt and run more efficiently for now. It helps that Canada has no real military budget. It also helps to have a huge pile of natural resources. (As does the U.S., Russia, China, Australia). ((Socialism tends to do better when there is money in the ground. Think Norway, Saudi Arabia.)) Then there is cultural cohesiveness, Canada wins that round as well. \nSad to hear that Canada\u2019s system is still starting to suffer the same woes as the U.S. system. It sounds like the aristocratic model of the U.S. \nUnfortunately, without a strong and vibrant U.S. economy to the south the Canadian system will be strained even more. RPT34 \nSouth Africa is very dangerous for white people. piccadillybabe \nI have traveled to a few foreign countries mostly Mexico, Belize, Virgin Islands and the Dominican. As beautiful as those countries are, they are third world. The US is becoming third world also but at least we have a ways to go yet before we are totally on the skids. Mexico would probably be my country of choice as I always felt kind of at home there, probably because Mexicans are very friendly, nice people and love gringos. It\u2019s true many Americans are packing it in and out. Teaching English (ESL) in a foreign country where there is a shortage of teachers is an option. TrailerParkOverpriced \nIf the USA becomes third world, the entire world goes down with it economically. Think about the loss of foreign monies into poor countries and remittances. The locals of other countries will become more poorer and desperate. David Kessel \nPS.

Where does one find information about specific things that we can do NOW as individual Americans to change and, hopefully, improve things? After weeks of searching, I have found nothing other than often powerful statements of commitment to our nation, to stand by it to the death, etc. As a Vietnam combat veteran, father, and grandfather, I feel exactly the same way. Organizing, setting individual differences aside, having specific beliefs and goals seem reasonable. So does getting rid of corrupt, lying politicians including (or especially) Obama \u2013 even taking on the \u201celites\u201d. These all sound like good ideas, but who is going to start the process and when? I am an oath keeper. I stand by the United States of America. I am ready to help, but where do we find information or other Americans who feel similarly? How do we start making a difference for the better? Undecider \nGoing down with the ship. Glory goes to God! TrailerParkOverpriced \nI know someone who wants to move out from Toronto, Canada into some quiet town. He/she/it said that Toronto has so many traffic, jobs being taken away for lower wages and rent is ridiculous, and the city is unfriendly. The person is moving somewhere in the Atlantic provinces with his/her life savings and thinking of setting up a small business. One bad part of a country has a good part of the country. \nAmerica and Canada have lots of places where one can live.

We have no idea how we got lumped into the groups that are considered \u201canti-American\u201d. As any friend or relative of a Mason knows, we believe in God (that, along with \u201cgeometry\u201d is what the \u201cG\u201d in our symbol represents). Many, if not most, of us believe that Jesus Christ is the true Son of God. We believe in the Holy Spirit and that the Holy Bible is the inspired word of God. I believe in the Communion of Saints. We exist to help, not hurt, our fellow man. Historically, Masons were architects. Shriners\u2019 Crippled Childrens\u2019 Hospitals, Shriners\u2019 Burns Institutes and Speech and Language Clinics at Universities across the country did not just appear. They were built and exist because of Masons. We have members of all racial/ethnic and religious creeds and beliefs. I am tired of seeing good people bashed undeservedly and literally due to ignorance. Again, how can we be successful if we are unable to overlook individual differences? S.I. Hayakawa wrote, \u201cA difference, in order to be a difference, has to make a difference\u201d.

This is despite never even being in South America (but did years of research searching for best place) before and not knowing Spanish. It was one of the best decisions I made in my life! I laugh at the question asking about what freedoms you give up. I have much more freedom down here than US: no TSA goons, no militarized cops, some of the lowest taxes in the world, no RIAA(pirated DVDs sold almost everywhere; even cops buy them), a mostly cash economy. The government is one of the smallest in the world in terms of % spending of GDP and is actually one of the few that are solvent. Language barriers are not as bad as people think as you can say a lot with pointing, and I know people who have lived here for years without speaking virtually any Spanish. More importantly the are not stockpiling billions of bullets and tens of thousands of drones to kill their own citizens when the economy collapses. I cannot tell you what a relief it was to get out of the USA. Huge sense of peace came over me knowing that no goon squad could raid me for collecting rainwater, growing grass too high, or drinking raw milk, or just criticizing the illegal alien in chief. I could not imagine being there now when the government is openly MURDERING journalists like Hastings. Malecon \nI just read your deleted comment about Nazism and fascism. Very informative.

We have many problems and they will get worse. Hopefully the rapture will come and my family and I will be living in heaven before the USA crashes. But for now America is a good place to line at least here in Delaware Oline Wright \nI moved to Australia in 2009. I did not leave because of what America is becoming I left because I fell in love with an Australian who I met over the internet. It took a long time for us to get together legally because the costs of immigration can be high if you don\u2019t have much money. Then there is the fact that you have to pass certain health checks and background checks etc. I am now approaching the point where I can be an Australian citizen. I will likely stay here for the rest of my life and it makes sense for me to become a citizen of the country I am living in. My problem is do I give up the citizenship of my birth? can I become a citizen of both? I know from a friend that when you become a citizen your visa/permanent residency is canceled because it is no longer considered necessary therein lies the rub. Will I be able to keep my American Passport if I apply for an AUstralian one as well? because that would be what I would have to do if I ever chose to return to the states for a visit to my family. I would need my American passport for the trip to America and my Australian Passport for the trip back to Australia which is now my home. Archie1954 \nThe main reason to leave the US is a moral one so obviously it wasn\u2019t mentioned in this propaganda piece, that is the constant military warmongering.

IF you want to leave then the best place to learn about the transition is from the expats who have already done it. \nI lived in Mexico three times without knowing Spanish and had no problems. Today Mexico is a war zone because of the US failed war on drugs and that is sad and yet ppl are still moving there which is crazy. \nThe world is a billion ppl overpopulated and crime among young ppl is real worldwide and will only continue, but the US is the most violent nation on earth that is not at war and far more dangerous than any of the many nations I have researched moving to, but what is most obvious is that expats are far more happy than they ever were in the US. Life has become too hard here for most and far too expensive by design and our politicians will not stop without an armed revolution and no one is talking about that. Tobias Smith \nit is time to eat a tuna fish sandwich sherpeace \nMost of these people left when Bush II was president.

Obama haters are not leaving, except for the Billionaires, but the truth is they have been leaving for a while.

S. of A. a long time ago, in 1976 (when Carter still was president). I did it for work reasons, but I had come to think that life would be better in the Dominion of Canada. I was right about that, too. However, missing friends and adjusting to the sheer gentility of Canadians, which can be a bit maddening for Americans, took time and effort. I know that today, leaving the truly dreadful U.

The quality of life in these countries is unbearable? \nHow can you leave luxury and go to poverty-stricken countries. Countries in Europe are congested and have their own relative cultures.

There are many countries that are much BETTER with food and medical care than the US. As far as war, the US is constantly at war. While it may be true that no part of the US is a current war zone, it doesn\u2019t mean we still can\u2019t be killed by opposing forces (9/11 anyone?). As far as making a living, many countries LOVE americans and will hire you quicker than their own fellow native people, ecspecially in asian countries. Personally, I crave culture shock, I think that\u2019s why a lot of people DO travel. \nAnd my friends and family can do as they wish.

I can\u2019t live in a culture full of hate. it\u2019s time to get out. Especially if you are a homeowner because your property, the single largest financial investment we all make, will be devalued in a depression and than we will be all stuck here. I am getting out before that happens. I don\u2019t feel this is the country with the values that I grew up with here. I had said that even if Hillary had won I wanted to leave because of the fact that half of the people were so full of hatred and aggressiveness. And, I can\u2019t live in a country that looks the other way when a candidate is a sexist, racist person. It is like saying that women are insignificant and we don\u2019t matter and it\u2019s open season on women and that is the way it is and deal with it. Well, I\u2019m dealing with it by leaving this place. I\u2019m done. No experience, no accounting experience, 6 bankruptcies, 5 Vietnam deferrments and the block of voters that put him over the top were very lowly educated people who probably only use their computers for fantasy football or nonsense instead of learning about the their candidate of choice and not just believing his sound bites. We have dropped in our level of education in the world standing and have uneducated, uninformed voters charting the future of our country. Is it any wonder we are headed for a huge fall? I am getting out before it happens. I feel for those who didn\u2019t support trump but I won\u2019t have a shred of mercy for those who did support him. You deserve what you get and I hope you suffer the worst for endangering the world economy and our values in this country. I hope you suffer the very worst and I\u2019ll be waving to all of you from my safe house in Canada. Good riddance!",

        "body_en": "Posted on July 4, 2014 by Dr. Eowyn | 37 Comments \nYesterday, after officiating at a wedding of two sodomites in New York, comedienne Joan Rivers outed the president and first lady of the United States as a homosexual and transgender, respectively. (See Steve\u2019s post here .) \nRivers was asked by an off-camera reporter: \u201cDo you think the country \u2026 United States will see the first gay president or first woman president?\u201d \nThis is what Joan Rivers said, sounding weary and definitely not in a joking mood: \n\u201cWe already have [the first gay president] with Obama, so let\u2019s just calm down. You know Michelle is a tranny\u2026 a transgender. We all know. \u201c We all know. \nOf course, by \u201cwe,\u201d Joan Rivers wasn\u2019t referring to ordinary American people, aka the sheeple who pay the taxes that (barely) holds the U.S. government together, who pay the movie tickets that maintain the Hollyweirdos in their extravagant and debauched \u201clifestyle\u201d. \nSo who are those \u201cwe\u201d who \u201call know\u201d all along that Obama is \u201cgay\u201d and his \u201cwife\u201d Michael \u2014 oops, Michelle \u2014 is really a man? Clue No. 1 \nRemember that Newsweek cover of May 21, 2012, proclaiming Obama to be \u201cThe First Gay President\u201d? \nNewsweek \u2018s orgasmic cover was prompted by Obama\u2019s reversal of the military\u2019s long-standing \u201cdon\u2019t ask don\u2019t tell\u201d policy and his open support of \u201cgay marriage.\u201d \nThe weekly magazine\u2019s accompanying cover story was written by the political pundit Andrew Sullivan, a public (i.e., outed) homosexual who wrote that Obama\u2019s support of gay marriage had brought him to tears. (Lest you get all misty-eyed sentimental, he\u2019s the same Andrew Sullivan who once said \u201cgay marriage\u201d does NOT mean monogamy. As he put it oh so delicately : \u201cthere is more likely to be greater understanding of the need for extramarital outlets between two men than between a man and a woman.\u201d) \nAt the time, we the sheeple thought Newsweek didn\u2019t literally mean Obama is \u201cthe first gay president\u201d. \nThink again. \nHomosexuals pride themselves on their gaydar. They have to, in order to find each other because homosexuals constitute only 3% of the U.S. population, according to the Williams Institute , UCLA\u2019s LGBT research think tank. That means Andrew Sullivan already knew Barack Hussein Obama is a homosexual, just as another public homosexual \u2014 conservative blogger Kevin Dujan of HillBuzz \u2014 has known all along. Clue No. 2 \n7 months after the Newsweek cover, Candy \u2014 the first transexual style magazine \u2014 caused a brief publicity stir when it chose for its cover a transgender model, Connie Fleming, bearing a decided resemblance to Michelle Obama. (See DCG\u2019s post about this here .) \nIn the words of Daily Mail : \u201cA striking transgender model made up to look like Michelle Obama being sworn into office has been put on the front cover of a U.S. magazine\u2026. Fleming is dressed in typical First Lady fashion, down to the pearl necklace. Even the hair style is reminiscent of President Barack Obama\u2019s wife, Michelle. \u201d \nFor Candy to do a cover story on a transgender U.S. president is bold enough, why pick a BLACK male-to-female transgender for its cover? And not just any black MtF transgender but one who resembles Michelle? Then have the model wear a wig just like Michelle\u2019s and a sleeveless dress just like Michelle\u2019s, exposing Fleming\u2019s toned muscular arms, of which Michael Obama is so proud and for which he is celebrated by all the Obama idolators in the MSM? Clue No. 3 \nFast forward 1\u00bd years to Time magazine\u2019s cover of June 9, 2014, proclaiming that we\u2019re at a \u201cTransgender Tipping Point: America\u2019s Next Civil Rights Frontier.\u201d (See my post, \u201c Transgender surgery now covered by bankrupt Medicare \u201c.) \nFor its cover picture, Time could have chosen any number of transgenders \u2014 male-to-female or female-to-male; white, black, yellow, brown. \nBut the magazine chose a BLACK male-to-female transgender, an obscure actor named Laverne Cox who also bears an uncanny resemblance to Michelle Obama. As observant FOTM commenter motherbarbarian noted: \u201cLooking at that Time cover photo, I am reminded of Michael Obama. Same sculpted arms and muscled legs.\u201d \nWink, wink. Nudge, nudge. \nFriends, we\u2019ve been played. \n\u201cWe all know.\u201d They all know. \nJoan Rivers, Andrew Sullivan, Newsweek , Candy , Time , and all the denizens of the \u201cliberal\u201d media and Hollywood have known all along. \nSee our posts:",

        "body_en": "Are The Polls Rigged Against Trump? All Of These Wildly Divergent Surveys Cannot Possibly Be Correct Michael On Television What Is The Best Place To Live In The United States To Prepare For The Coming Economic Collapse?   May 2nd, 2011 \nWhat is the best place to live in the United States? I get asked that question all the time. My answer can be summed up in two words: it depends. The truth is that the answer is going to be different for each person. All of us have different goals and different needs. If you have a very strong network of family and friends where you live right now, you might want to think twice before moving hundreds or thousands of miles away. If you have a great job where you live right now, you might want to hold on to it. You should not just assume that you are going to be able to pick up and move to another part of the country and be able to get a similar job right away. The United States is in the midst of a very serious economic decline right now, and wherever you live you are going to have to provide for your family. Just because you move somewhere new does not mean that you are going to leave your problems behind. In fact, you might find that they moved right along with you. With all that being said, the reality is that there are some places in the U.S. that are going to be much more desirable than others when the economy totally falls apart. For example, during a total economic collapse it will not be good to be living in a large city or in a densely populated area. Just think about what happened in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. If the entire nation is going through something like that, you don\u2019t want to have hundreds of thousands of close neighbors at that point. So when thinking about where you want to be when everything falls apart, population density should be a major factor. But there are other factors as well and no area of the United States is perfect. \nIf you live in or near a major city right now, that is okay. Most Americans do. Even if you have limited financial resources at the moment, you can start developing a plan that will get you where you eventually want to go. If you want to move to another part of the country you can start applying for jobs out there. You can also be working hard to develop a business that would enable you to move. Perhaps you have friends or family in more isolated areas that would allow you to stay with them during an economic collapse. \nThose that possess more financial resources could start thinking about getting a second home in a location that is more rural. \nThe key is to come up with a plan and to be working towards accomplishing that plan. \nIf you don\u2019t have a plan yet, hopefully the following information will give you something to think about. Not all areas of the United States are equal, and all of them do have problems. \nThe following are some thoughts about the best place to live in the United States\u2026. \nThe Northeast \nA major problem with the Northeast is that it is just so darn crowded. Yes, there are some rural areas, but the overall population density of the region is so high that it would be really hard to go unnoticed for long in the event of a major economic collapse. \nAnother thing that is not great about the Northeast is that so much of the population lives near the coast. As we saw in Japan recently, living near a coastline is not necessarily a good thing. While it is likely safer to live along the east coast then the west coast, the truth is that there is an inherent level of insecurity when it comes to living in coastal areas. You never know when the next hurricane, oil spill or tsunami is going to strike. \nAlso, the Northeast is really quite cold. So staying warm and growing your own food would be more difficult than in some other areas of the country. \nThe Mid-Atlantic \nThe Mid-Atlantic is one of the most beautiful areas of the nation. Unfortunately, it suffers from many of the same problems that the Northeast does. \nThe Mid-Atlantic has a very high population density. For example, the area around Washington D.C. is pretty much all suburbs for 50 miles in all directions. \nThe weather is nicer than in the Northeast and there are some less dense areas once you get south of Washington D.C. \nIf you think that the Mid-Atlantic might be for you, you might want to check out North Carolina or South Carolina. The people tend to get friendlier the further south you go and there are definitely some areas that could potentially work. \nFlorida \nFlorida is generally not going to be a place that you want to be during an economic collapse. The housing market has absolutely collapsed down there and the crime rate is already very high. It is also very densely populated. \nThe weather is very nice down in Florida, but one big thing that you need to consider when it comes to Florida is the fact that it is very flat and most of Florida is just barely above sea level. In fact, quite a bit of Florida is actually below sea level. \nIn addition, hurricanes are always a major threat in Florida. It is a beautiful state, but there is a lot of risk to living down there. \nThe Southeast \nThe Southeast has really taken a pounding over the last few years. First it was Hurricane Katrina, and then it was the BP oil spill and then it was the tornadoes of 2011 . \nThere is a lot of poverty in that area of the country. There is also a lot of crime. \nThere are a lot of great people who live down in the Southeast, but if you do not know your way around it can be a very difficult place to move to. \nThe Mid-South \nOne of my favorite places east of the Mississippi River are the mountains along the Tennessee/North Carolina border. If you must be in the eastern half of the United States, that is not a bad choice. \nWhere you do not want to be is anywhere near the New Madrid fault zone . The New Madrid fault zone covers portions of Illinois, Indiana, Missouri, Arkansas, Kentucky, Tennessee and Mississippi. The biggest earthquakes in the history of the United States were caused by the New Madrid fault. Many are convinced that we are going to see an absolutely catastrophic earthquake along the New Madrid fault at some point. \nSo if you want to live in the Mid-South, it is highly recommended that you stay far away from the New Madrid fault zone. \nThe Upper Midwest \nThe Upper Midwest was once one of the great manufacturing regions of the world, but now much of it is known as the \u201crust belt\u201d. \nFormerly great manufacturing cities such as Detroit are now absolute hellholes . Tens of thousands of our factories and millions of our jobs have been shipped overseas. \nThere are some really great people (including some good friends of this column) that live up there, but the truth is that the region is really cold and unemployment is rampant. \nThe Upper Midwest is an area that people want to get out of. It is probably not a great place to move to. \nHowever, if you do need a job, one place to look is a little bit west of there. Thanks to an abundance of natural resources, unemployment in North Dakota and South Dakota is very low. If you really need a job you might want to look into those two states. \nThe Southwest \nIn the Southwest there are a whole lot of freedom-loving Americans, the weather is very warm and there is a lot of space to get lost. \nHowever, the Southwest is also very dry and in many areas there is not a lot of water. Drought and wildfires are quite common. \nIn addition, illegal immigration is rampant and is a constant security threat. \nIf you are familiar with that area of the country it is not a bad choice, but if you do not know what you are doing it could end up being disastrous for you. \nThe Great Plains \nAs long as you are far enough away from the New Madrid fault, the Great Plains is not a bad choice. \nIt is very, very flat out there, and it can be quite windy, but the good news is that you should be able to grow your own food. \nIn addition, the population density is generally very low in most areas. \nOne big negative, as we have seen recently, is tornadoes. The United States experiences more tornadoes that anywhere else in the world, and \u201ctornado alley\u201d generally gets the worst of it. \nThe West Coast \nDuring an economic collapse, the West Coast is not a place that you will really want to be. Just take a look at the state of California already. It is an economic nightmare . \nMillions of people have left California over the past couple of decades. The millions of people that have left have been replaced mostly with illegal aliens. \nOregon is better, although they have very high taxes and they are experiencing huge economic problems right now as well. \nThe best area along the West Coast is the Seattle area, but you won\u2019t want to be anywhere near a major population center when things totally fall apart. \nAlso, the West Coast lies along the \u201c Ring of Fire \u201c. Considering what just happened in Japan and what has been happening in other areas along the Ring of Fire lately, the West Coast is not an area that a lot of people are recommending. \nThe Northwest \nLarge numbers of freedom-loving Americans have been moving to the states of Montana, Idaho and Wyoming. You can also throw eastern Washington and eastern Oregon into this category as well. \nIt gets cold up in the Northwest, but not as cold as the Upper Midwest. There are lots of rivers, streams and lakes and in certain areas there is plenty of rain. \nThe population density is very low in most areas and there is an abundance of wildlife. Housing prices are reasonable and in many areas you can grow your own food. \nThe Northwest is one of the favorite areas of the United States for preppers. It is far from perfect, but it does have a lot of advantages. \nAlaska And Hawaii \nNeither Alaska or Hawaii is recommended. Alaska lies along the \u201cRing of Fire\u201d and it is very, very cold. Also, almost everything has to be either shipped or flown into Alaska. In the event of a real economic collapse, supplies to Alaska could be cut off and shortages could develop very quickly. \nHawaii has a huge population and it does not have a lot of room. Like Alaska, most supplies have to be either shipped in or flown in. And one really bad tsunami could pretty much wipe Hawaii out. \nBut once again, there is no \u201cright answer\u201d. There are areas of just about every U.S. state that could potentially work well during a major economic collapse. \nWhen assessing where \u201cthe best place to live in the United States\u201d is, it is important to examine your own personal factors. What will work for me and for my family will not necessarily work for you and your family. \nSo what do all of you think about this list? Which area of the country do you think is best for those Americans who are seeking to prepare themselves for the coming economic collapse? Scott \nI have actually been thinking about this lately. And population and weather are the two biggest factors. emma \nThis whole Osama dead Stuff really gets to me. \nThe guy from FFT summed it up perfectly. \nhttp://www.forecastfortomorrow.com/news/2011/05/osama-bin-laden-dead/ \nNever before has this country embraced Empire so willingly. Never before have we given up, wholesale, our precious liberties won with the blood of our countrymen. For what?? Some lame ass guy in a cave somewhere that represents some of the best thinking of the 13th Century? This is beyond ridiculous, it is totally absurd. Nickelthrower \nGreetings, \nI can\u2019t help but laugh when I read blogs such as this. I hate to break it to everyone but no place is going to be very safe. Hear me out then see if you don\u2019t agree. \nIf the economic tsunami that is headed our way includes the loss of international oil then it wont matter if you are in New York City or the Deep South. \nWe now know (because we have their documents) what the Soviet Union planned to do to destroy the U.S.A. Whereas we intended to nuke everything and anything in an attempt to kill as many Russians as possible, the Russians believed that they could kill even more Americans by just using a few dozen or so nukes on a few of our ports and all of our major oil refineries. \nWhere we planned to annihilate everyone in every major city in the Soviet Union, they figured that they could kill even more Americans by just shutting off the oil. They knew that the loss of oil would cause pandemonium in the U.S.A and that the starving people would spill out of the cities and eat up everything until there was nothing left and no means to grow or obtain any more. \nLet me reiterate it again for you just to make sure you got it: The loss of oil brought about by the collapse of the dollar will be more devastating than a nuclear holocaust. \nWhatever little \u201cAlamo\u201d you set up for yourself in Hillbilly Land wont be so much as a speed bump when thousands of hungry people descend upon it. \nDo a little research and read about what a famine of biblical proportions looks because that is what will go down when the pumps go dry. shawn \nThat was pretty interesting and it make since. It actually just reinforces the conclusion I have drawn. N. Dakota is the place I think I am gonna move my family to as soon as I can.Its gonna take people a while to run outta the major cities into n. Dakota as there are no major cities close in any direction.This would give N. Dakota plenty of time to prepare. N. Dakota has it\u2019s own state bank.It also has nuclear war heads stationed there and if the people and local authorities could seize control of them it would go a long way in defending itself from a tyrannical federal government. It has an abundance of oil and agriculture. Also, it is the state that could most easily succeed from the union (even more likely than Texas) as technically it never really was properly admitted into the union. It is cold and flat but that has kept the wrong kind of people away. N. Dakota also has 0 debt and did not take federal bail out money so they have the right mentality and they already want to succeed. Missy \nThat was an excellent article Michael!! You are such an excellent writer. I am really looking forward to the comments that will be left on this article. The middle of the US is certainly one of the safer places to live. VegasBob \nThe Central and Eastern areas of Washington State are actually a fairly nice place to be. The people are generally friendly, and they are far less judgmental than Southerners (I am a native Southerner, so I know just how judgmental Southerners can be). The trouble is that there is not a lot of cultural stuff going on \u2013 symphonies, museums, theatres, etc. Maria \nWe have lived in many different states over the last 25 years from Alaska and Hawaii in the west to Virginia in the east and Texas in the south. We are convinced you are right\u2026there is no perfect place. People need to decide which drawbacks they are most capable of dealing with (snow, rain, heat, earthquakes, etc) and plan accordingly. \nIf it gets much worse economically, one thing will be certain\u2026if you can\u2019t protect what you have, then you won\u2019t have it for very long. \nI pray it doesn\u2019t get that bad. Pat \nI live in Alaska and just got back from vacationing down south. Alaska may be cold and hostile, but one thing it has going for it is stability \u2013 something I\u2019ve noticed the lower 48 has been lacking lately. If you know how to live in cold-weather environments, Alaska ain\u2019t a bad choice. Gutter Economist \nPeople need to start thinking about what comes after the economic collapse. I would look for states that are rich in natural resources and away from coastal areas. \nIf we have a civil war, I would like to see the following states pull out the union and become the Mountain States of America. With respect to natural resources, these states might include Colorado, North Dakota, South Dakota, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Utah, and Wyoming. If residents of these states were smart, they would pull out of the union ASAP. Hognutz \nI\u2019m staying right here on my farm in good old S.C. \nOne thing not mentioned is family support and real friends. If you have them you might be better off with them\u2026.. karl \nYellowstone Patty \nMy husband and I saw this coming over 12 years ago as we were living in Florida. With crime, drugs and homeless people all around us. We looked at Tennessee but it just wasn\u2019t right for us. We ended up in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. I notice more than not that when people think of Michigan they ALWAYS think Detroit. Evidenced once again in your article. The UP is the land of God so to speak with great natural resources, good and plentiful water and lots and lots of land. The people up here are resourceful and know how to live off the land. Yes it\u2019s cold and I like it that way because it discourages the type of people that all southern and warm states have too many of\u2026\u2026\u2026. shawn \namen J \nIf you are willing to work abroad there are many countries where you can teach English. Just get the CELTA. It\u2019s a four week English teaching certificate. Here are a few sites that list ESL teaching jobs abroad: \nhttp://www.teachaway.com \nI am a U.S. citizen and I am currently teaching physics in Saudi Arabia with a lot of expats from all over the west. Many teachers here have purchased property abroad since the cost of living is cheaper like Malaysia, Thailand, and the Philippines. \nPlease go to http://www.trulia.com because you will find many inexpensive property listings all over the U.S. there. There are some great property listings in the Portland, Oregon area. \nI hope this helps. Owen \nLike the old gospel song proclaims \u201cThere\u2019s no hiding place down here.\u201d Your preparatins will be in vain if you disregard this truth. The time is short aa it appears to this reader that we have now entered the beginning of sorrows. Just Me \nother than the northwest, I\u2019ll still stick with Pa or Central NY, it gets a little cold and there is some snow, but we don\u2019t have to worry about forest fires, earth quakes,floods, tornadoes,hurricanes,Tsunamies,mud slides,poison snakes,scorpions,alligators,fresh water,very few draughts,burning heat waves,high moisture. and there won\u2019t be very many roving bandits from Sept til June. Wood Burner \nMost people who live on the Great Plains have only seen a tornado on the weather channel. The damage done by twisters is very localized and narrow. Most assuredly not a factor in determining whether to locate there or not. \nAlso, using possibles like the New Madrid fault as a factor in where to locate is like using the possibility of zombie rabbits popping up. There is just no certainty of any event like a huge earthquake occurring in the center of the U.S. Mathematically it can not even be an issue. \nWhat can be stated with certainty is the fact that when the SHTF you will not want to be in or near a large city of any kind. There the possibility of encountering zombie criminals of the human type is not only high but virtually assured. One can make preparations but how does one keep the provisions from being taken by starving idiots? You can try to defend your position but the numbers are against you. \nUltimately there is only one way anybody gets out of this life with a chance of redemption. Use it. Rev 6:5 \nI think the best place to go in the event of a economic collapse or something much worse would be out in Utah. Most of Utah is isolated except around Salt Lake City. The weather isnt that bad in winter but summers can get hot in the southern half of the state. I would definetly recommend living near a water source such as a lake or river. There are places around Fruita, UT that grow crops out in the middle of the desert because of the Freemont River. Living in the mountains would be fine in the summer but they can recieve a lot of snow and cold from October to May. Utah just seems to me to be the most practical location. Matt \nIt must be warm year round. Southwest wins here. Summer heat is very uncomfortable but extreme cold is much worse if you cannot afford the high cost of heating or cooling your home. J \nAnother good thing about living and teaching abroad is that you don\u2019t have to pay taxes. Just file the 2555-EZ form. jet \nI would pass on Oregon and Washington. The taxes are incredibly high, there is always the threat of tsunami or earthquake and it rains or is cloudy for about nine months a year, people are in a constant state of depression because of the weather. Oh, and it is liberal in the extreme. People here don\u2019t like \u201cfreedom loving Americans\u201d, aka conservatives. Freedom Lover \nMontana, Idaho and Wyoming depends if you are in one of the wolf high population areas you could not pick a worst area. Wildlife is being slaughtered off in record numbers. Ranchers forced out of business that milk cow and chickens for survival would be close to impossible to raise. Now the wolves are spreading disease to the animals and people. Before you even think of moving to one of these 3 States you should watch Yellowstone is Dead. \nWhere ever you pick make sure you have your own well water is going to be very important and you truly can\u2019t store enough water. Massivecarbunkle \nEveryone must find a place, surely most will want to be near blood relatives, those who grew up in the 80\u2019s when the media taught them to be independent and far from home, they will find it very hard, very, very, hard indeed. Most strangers in places they are not familiar with during the economic collapse will be dissed and treated very harsh and left for dead by city dwellers. For this was the GREAT SIN of the citizens of Sodom and Gomorrah, the wicked and cruel treatment of strangers. jose puta \nthe best place for you to live is on the Amazon with the tribes, quit spreading your disease. JH \nThere are some great areas in California along the Sierra Mountain range and in Northern California. They are warm most the year, have very fertile soil for gardening, low population density, natural beauty and water sources (off the mountains). Yes, taxes and property rates are high and employment is tough, but if you can work from home or are retired, not a bad option. \nSouthern Colorado in the Rockies is another good option with limited government, cheap land, low population density, water sources, few gun laws, etc. It gets cold, but not as cold as other places. Judith \nYou are forgetting the Yellowstone volcano. That should pretty much take care of the Northwest. Adrian \nI noticed lately that more Americans are moving to Australia. We have plenty of rooms and we love Americans. So come on over. Gary2 \nWe have a large body of fresh water on our door step. Lake MI looks as big as any ocean from the shore line. Please keep telling people to not move here (WI) as I hate crowds and a lot of people clogging up everything. The cold keeps the nasty bugs at bay. If you need a well you can pretty much sink a hole anywhere and get wonderful water. With water shortages we are positioned quite well. Steve \nEconomic collapse? Do you really know how the collapse will happen? How about a Mexico border state like TX, NM or AZ. Start a garden. In a rural area a little south of a big city. Learn spanish and have a little vacation home in Mexico to escape to with a Peso bank account. Keep your van packed ready to run. Would love to have a little Wine and Coffee plantation near the Mexican town of Chicxulub in the Yucat\u00e1n peninsula run by a bunch of nice se\u00f1oritas. InArizona \nI think you are wrong about Alaska, there are many places in Alaska that are WARMER than the Northwest in the Winter. Anywhere along the water is more temperate than the Northern part of the Cont US. Also, Alaska has abundant LARGE game, fish, and other resources that no other state does. Forget about shipments up there, what would you need? Lumber is available, oil, and nat gas are everywhere\u2026 Not to mention\u2026 the VERY long growing days in the summer produce some of the largest fruits and vegatables\u2026. just take a look at the Palmer Fair each fall\u2026 Also, tidal waves, volcanos are an issue as well as earthquakes, but just living away from low lying coastal areas would mitigate that threat. One thing about Alaska\u2026 you NEVER have to worry about a drought! So summertime will produce plenty of vegatables\u2026 wheat and grains don\u2019t work so well, but I have been successful growing corn, risky and a lot of work, but it can be done. \nI think that as a human being you would find most of the resources you need up there, without the competition for resources, which needs to be taken into consideration. \nSo, my short answer, it depends on how BAD it gets, Alaska would be perfect WTSHTF! InArizona \njust so you know, I currently live in Arizona, and am originally from Alaska\u2026 born and raised, been in AZ for 10 years now. \nI can see advantages to both places to live, but I really worry about water here, and the availability of game animals. I am also out of my element, so when I go into survival mode, I am thinking about Alaska. \nHere in the desert all we have is bunnies and cacti\u2026 I don\u2019t know how to build a home from cacti, and eating those darn bunnies would eventually get very old! (I currently have moose meat and smoked salmon in my freezer\u2026you can take the girl out of the trailer park, but you can\u2019t take the trailer park out of the girl!) tobage \nRural Southwestern Michigan \nThe Great Lakes area is the Saudi Arabia of freshwater in general, but SW Mich has some of the most fertile land on Earth\u2026AND a 180 day growing season\u2026that will only be getting longer thanks to abrupt climate shift. \nExtremely few places on planet Earth have this. \nAnd THIS\u2026\u2026 is all that will matter. \nI bet thats why you are sterring people away. wink wink\u2026 foldenfan \nWe are in west central Minnesota, and feel pretty good about our area. Yes, it has cold winters (though the summers are the best I have ever seen), but as has been said about the cold winters, \u201cIt helps keep the riff-raff out.\u201d We have lived in Colorado, Oregon, Washington, and have a lot of experience with Wyoming and Montana. We feel this is the safest place for us. \nGardening for food here is great, good soil, adequate rain, growing season is such that if we can\u2019t grow it, we don\u2019t need it. Lots of cattle (dairy & beef) in our area, low population, and the people are of the best overall quality we have seen anywhere. Main farm crops here are corn, wheat, oats, hay, barley,soybeans, potatoes, flax, sugar beets, etc. \nAverage folks here are conservative (most of the Libs are in the cities), and well armed. As for wildlife, we have lots of deer, turkey, pheasant are making a comeback, and thousands of lakes for fishing. Also have some wolves, coyotes, and a few bear around. \nWe feel that when Teotwaki hits we will have as good a chance here as anywhere. \nLand is relatively inexpensive compared to most regions that have \u201cusable\u201d land. We have 80 acres, 50 in Oak trees (LOT\u2019s of excellent firewood), and 30 open for gardens and fields. I will admit that land is more expensive now than when we bought back in 1997. Overall, we\u2019ve been here 20+ years so we have considerable experience in this area. Gist of my comment is, don\u2019t sell parts of MN and the eastern Dakotas short. Marlene Spence \nSan Juan Capistrano California is beautiful. We grow vegetables, etc. and have survival food purchased from Jim Bakker Ministries. We do have a nuclear plant near by, however. I think Nuclear Plants need to be considered. JD \nThank you Michael. I still know Montana is far perfect but when the weather is nice like it is today this truly is the last best place. Except for Yellowstone. But you cant think that its going to blow up everyday it would make you insane. Michael \nWhen Yellowstone goes, it will generally be better to be north and west of it rather than east and south of it. JD \nOh some good news I might be able to get my old job back after getting laid off two years ago. I would be happier than i have been in a long time. I pray and i believe it will happen. Everyone reading this blog there is hope out there. Im glad its here for all of us to share our thoughts. Home is what you make of it. Like Michael was saying about using your family and connections where you live is important. It may be your only hope. I grateful even tho im techincally homeless and my friend lets me use his computer the weather is getting nicer Bin Laden is dead today is awesome. I love MT & i totally agree with gutter econonmist that Rocky Mt States of America will happen. Eastern OR & Spokane could join just as long as not too many hippies invade here. Ooops I guess theres Missoula too late.. morpheus \nI know it seems like our only choice is to retreat and run for the hills. Big mistake! Because soon everyone will follow.

The thought that it is a Democracy has led us to the situation we\u2019re in today. Our country is a Republic. Period. Not a Democracy, not a Democratic Republic. A Republic, a form of government where 99% can\u2019t vote away the rights of 1%. Kevin \nRegardless if there is a collapse or not it would be wise to live where there would be jobs in gainful private sector employment. Those states with significant shale natural gas deposits and farming would be the best bet. Even if your not directly working in either field there are support jobs that come along for the ride. Small town western Pennsylvania may be a choice. Pennsylvania is Philadelphia and Pittsburg with West Virginia in the middle. Once out of the damn few cities the place is Maybury RFD. Thinkaboutit \nGlad you recommended against Hawaii, because there are plenty of people there\u2026but Tsunami only affects the coast\u2026there are great higher elevation places to live in Hawaii where the food falls out of trees along with fresh rainwater nearly every night ryan \ni live in rural western wa and its not as liberal as one would think.most all libs live in seattle and the other bigger citys on the coast but every where out side of that is good old americans!everybody i no are gun owners on a large scale to say in the long run that we will be overrun by starving people after the callapse is nonsense we will fort up and protect ourselves and are familys and friends!besides most will be killed by mobbs or will starve before they can even try to get out of the city. people underestimate us country folk! smarter than you \nEureka, California is the best place you can possibly live. Don\u2019t argue with me. Just get your ass to Eureka. Thomas \nHawaii seems a good choice. Plenty of military around to help keep order and a preferred place for Asian visitors.

It is the west side of the state that has most of the population (think Seattle) and the rain. East of the Cascades is much better for the things we\u2019re talking about -plenty of water, decent growing season, lots of wildlife (animals not bars)and fishing. Yes there\u2019s snow, but that clears out the \u201csnow birds\u201d who won\u2019t make it anyway in a big catastrophe. It also makes for a lot of fun during the winter months with skiing, snowshoeing, etc. Good luck everybody. DJ \nI live in Alaska. Moved heree from Kentucky because of all the people. I have acclimated to the environment now. Coal is on top of the ground in places and trees are abundant, I have a wood/coal burning stove in my log home. Its warm, I am oof the grind and I live at least 100 miles from the nearest population base of any size. \nHeirloom seeds, my own well, two years of dehydrated food and I am a fire arms instructor with lots of instructional equipment\u2026. Just like home. And if I am a Hillbilly then so be it. I will make it. Rod \nNot mentioned but should be considered is proximity to nuclear power plants. I wouldn\u2019t want to be within 50 miles downwind from one. Another good point about a northern climate is food storage is easier and pests can be less bothersome than a southern climate. Ben Dover \nI read the article with an open mind and came away with the thought that the author is of the opinion that all 300 million of us are doomed and should just eat a bullet\u2026it\u2019s why i do not often read this stuff\u2026common sense, it ain\u2019t common\u2026 mondobeyondo \nBut be warned, stock up on potatoes. Potatoes don\u2019t grow well out here in the desert. Don J \nRight. No perfect place, but I feel that where we live (East Texas) is perfect for us, primarily because my brothers and I inherited over 1,000 acres. We have lakes with fish, tillable garden/crop areas including areas close to our water wells, there are wild hogs that populate the area that are delicious and deer. We can butcher our own meat and cook it over hardwood fires, in an oven or deep fried. We can raise just about any vegetable and most fruit. We know how to prepare and can veggies and fruit. Not too sure how to can meat, but I feel that we could always have fresh meat either with fish, wild hog, or venison in season. There\u2019s no closed season on hogs. We have generators to keep our freezers going and house powered. We have diesel and gasoline stored in overhead tanks. We have guns and bullets and the ability to reload hunting and handgun rounds. Have we thought of everything? Probably not, but if we have to, we think we could survive some very hard times, if it comes to pass. I wish everyone the best. DJ Tom Hallett \nWhile the mid-atlantic does indeed have its share of exposed coastline, you failed to mention the very rural Susquehanna basin. \nFrom southeastern Pennsylvania to northeastern Maryland, the Susquehanna basin is quite rural, lush, and teeming with food on hoof and fin. \nThanks for keeping our little secret! Big Dave \nI live in Central Texas which is greener than most people think. Water has always been a concern, but now that I am collecting thousands of gallons off my roof I don\u2019t worry about it. Nothing tastes better. The freedoms we have in Texas are great and I know because I grew up in California. The economy is better here and though we do have money shortfalls we are not bankrupt. Yes it\u2019s hot, but I\u2019d rather have heat than extreme cold. God bless Texas! kebozarth \nThank you for your heads-up. DownWithLibs \n@ Vegas Bob: \nTY! Yes, we haven\u2019t quite caught the horrible, sad mental illness known as \u201cLiberalism\u201d. Our strong-rooted Conservatism genes seem to be fending it off quite well. Although I do fear the day that our defenses get weakened. DownWithLibs \n@ Gary2: \nI see when it comes to \u201cspreading the wealth\u201d in the property department, you suddenly don\u2019t feel like sharing. (I believe the word we are after here is Hypocrite!) Richard \nYou really need to leave the United States altogether and choose a country that is not about to be subjected to the horrors of a gut-wrenching depression. Asia is the obvious choice. They will suffer from the coming bust as well but thereafter they will pick themselves up, dust themselves off, bounce back and go from strength to strength. The Asians do not carry the crushing debts that will hobble the United States and Europe for generations to come. If you\u2019re looking for a country where they speak English, Malaysia\u2019s your answer. Ted \nNW NJ is overlooked. Much has been done to preserve the truly pristene waters and farmlands of this area. Please do not judge what you have not tasted.It is still known as the Garden State.Quality of life will continue to be good because the people have a spirit of survival and work ethhic.A challenge here is an everyday occurance. If you can make it here you can make it anywhere. Home is where you make it. What are you running from? Okie Dan \nIt is extremely difficult to predict what the fallout would be with an economic collapse. Will martial law take place? Will redistribution of wealth occur? Will military forces simply be used to round up unemployed masses especially in the city? Will the economic collapse have only marginally increased changes than the present situation? There can be no certainty in planning for the scenario. Obviously networks matter. I imagine Oklahoma to be for most people better than Illinois in such a scenario. But I have a sister and brother-in-law,and nephews in Illinois with a spacious house and they farm. I could move there, while in Oklahoma without a job, my network would likely not be nearly so solid nor certain. Lots to think about. metalurgy \nWelp, glad you are discouraging the Midwest. That is where I live. In MN. Happy to see the riff raff leave and move south to warmer climates. \nI know how to and have backpacked and camped in 80 below windchill in the middle of winter mutiple times in my life and was extremely warm and comfortable. \nEasy if you know how to live in this type of environment. \nThere is a ton of food to eat, even in the winter time. I don\u2019t need a job and I don\u2019t need uncle Sam to survive. \nNot for everybody here in freezing MN but then I like it that way. Doc Loch \nMontana is great. Been here all my 45 yrs. (Except short jaunts of a few years to Germany and Oregon). You are all welcome here, and the beauty is unsurpassed, but don\u2019t forget that if you can\u2019t handle 45 degrees BELOW zero for 2 to 4 weeks at a time and lots of snow, then you can\u2019t wear the badge!

I have a good fishing boat and a motorcycle (55 mpg) and am 45 minutes from the nearest coast and 300 yards to woods (a forest) and a huge fresh water spring fed river. I like Florida and where I am at for what is coming.

Fear profits man nothing.\u201d HT Liu \nDon\u2019t escape. Try not to allow the economic disaster to happen. Vote with your head but not your feet. Stop voting for immoral politicians who continue irresponsible wild spending, uncontrolled growth of debt, and irrational increases of taxes. The best solution is to never, never, never re-elected anyone. Check what politicians do but don\u2019t listen to what they have to say. If you can\u2019t do that, you deserve a disaster.

Texas Tea \nBefore BO was elected I mentioned to a friend that I was considering moving back to Texas. She said I should do it soon, so I wouldn\u2019t have to go through Customs! Well, I moved and I\u2019m happy to say we\u2019re still a part of the good old USA. We\u2019re just different enough, however, that if the SHTF we would lock those borders down, become the world\u2019s fifth biggest economy, and feast on our oil, coal, forests, lakes, rivers, farms, wildlife, and football.

Don\u2019t worry about the new madrid, worry about supplies like tolet paper\u2026.. Ben rhea \nThere is no place that you can consider best when economic collapse is already here. Doomsday scenarios rarely ever come true. I think this will iron out, but houses are not going to get really cheap any time soon if at all, and currency war still boiling, plus the riots in Middle East which has an indirect effect to all and natural calamities all over the world. I understand that our country is completely out of control. One would have to wonder if the truth even exists for people, much less corporations. The U.S.\u2019s unemployment stats are more manipulated, kneaded & massaged than the thighs on a world-class ballerina. \nHate applying to jobs? Let us do it for you. Human job search assistant \u2013 http://www.jobwaltz.com \nNorth Central and North West U.S. are good bets. They have tough cold seasons, but that will drive away those with not so good work ethics. \nPart of Americas problem is too many living off of those who are working. \nSouth California will be a lost cause as Mexico tries to take over. Texas on the other hand is not going to be very forgiving to those who have raped our system for years. I have worked with plenty of decent hard working Hispanics. But a good chunk of them don\u2019t care for America or the Gringos. \nNorth East will be bad when all the spent rod ponds at the nuke plants start going dry and you have radiation clouds down wind from them. \nThe coasts offer fish and water. It will be hard to over fish the oceans. You can also desalinate enough water to survive, especially if you have a hot day. Hurricanes can be prepared for, tsunamis, not so. So the East coast might be the better choice, unless you have a little elevation. There is historical evidence of major Tsunamis in Oregon AND SoCal in the last few hundred years.. \nLast bit of advice. If you have an acre or more, you absolutely should have a way to store 3 K gallons of water. No excuse if you have the rain. I hate seeing all that fresh water go down the ditch to the creek. \nSierra Dave coal \nWhat about being mobile with a camper of some sort. You would have to have access to a good supply of fuel? At any rate, too many variables to consider a place of safety. What looks good today could very well be the worst place to go after some event takes place. Being mobile, a better chance of being able to move swiftly as the situation dictates?? Hal \nGloom & Doom. Looks like we are in for some really bad times. Or not! USA has been through tough times before and bounced back every time. I don\u2019t expect this to be any different, but it may take a little longer. It would probably help if all you pessimists and doomsayers(cons or lib) would quit whining and speculating and get of your dead asses to do something positive for a change. OK, off the soapbox\u2026where to live\u2026.anywhere your heart desires No rules, but..buy property, preferably rural(at least one acre), if you can. If you can\u2019t afford or borrow, work, work , work till you have the means. Improve your credit and use it only for buying property(not for toys). Learn cycles\u2026do not buy during highs in the area. Do this and you will all at least survive any downturn and be better off than I am(retired, living in FL in an average house, on a small lot, close to the beach, but running out of money). Complaining? Nah. I have lived in many areas of the USA and UK and loved every minute. Endured tornadoes, hurricanes, floods, and burglaries, all part of life. GET OVER IT!! Live your life!! Use good old American know how and innovation. Chris \nIf you agree with the premise that America is going to suddenly turn into Afghanistan over night then perhaps the rural/survivalist move is the way to go. If you believe that the descent will occur over 10-20 years you want to be urban. You want to be able to walk/bike to wherever you need. You need access to public transportation. You need access to jobs. Yes, there will still be jobs in the US and jobs equals money. We won\u2019t be bartering chickens for healthcare any time soon. You need public services such as fire and police as it is unlikely the suburbs will be supported by services or infrastructure improvements. Any further than the near suburbs will be completely out of the question for any support system whatsoever. Those areas will be sacrificed to the budgetary gods. Let\u2019s be honest, very very very few people are going to be capable of being self sufficient. \nObviously, most of the commenters think they they are the second coming of Grizzly Adams. Good for them. And good luck. You will need it. For the other 298 million of us, being close to the core and the support of friends and neighbors very close by is the best place to be for at least the next decade +. Larry Calhoun \nAt this time being very disabled I\u2019m living with family just East of Houston, TX.

One great thing about living in \u2018the Republic of Texas\u2019s is that this State has reserved the right to secede from the USA ***if*** necessary.

Fed Up \n(Opps, I put this in the wrong article, belongs here) \nWe are planning on moving to Colorado. As \u201cJD\u201d said in another discussion, \u201cthe Rockies are the last best place.\u201d \nColorado already has lots of preppers, organized in various areas and they meetup as a group a few times a year. CO has low taxes, hardly any gun laws, and a history of independent thinking and self-reliance. If you live at lower elevations the weather is perfect four seasons, with LOTS of sunshine, no natural disasters (except forest fires), and NO BUGS. Water can be an issue, but there are lots of creeks, rivers, and good wells if you look for them. \nThere\u2019s plenty of wildlife, fishing, and firewood. Except for the ski and resort areas, housing and land prices are very affordable in the remoter areas. Slade \nIn the UNlikely event of a complete breakdown of the economy and law and order, our best bet is the two Fs: Family and Firearms. Gary2 \nHT Liu-good point we need to not let the economic collapse happen in the first place. \nPeople need to stop voting for any republican period. They need to look at what any dem does and not what they say. I am so sick of dems talking a good progressive game and then being way too conservative like Obama. \nYes, Obama is better than any republican but I am really getting sick of choosing the lesser of 2 evils. \nI want Bernie Sanders for President. redgypsy \nLook West of Port Angeles WA Can feed a large family on 5 acres with food to spare. Quite and remote and plenty of resourses. Dee \nYou never mentioned Colorado? We have fresh mountain streams,plenty of game and not too many overcrowded areas. Plus, a large number of people who know how to survive off of the land and who are already starting to band together and plan\u2026 \nOur Gourmet Survival Food Business Opportunity \nThe best place to live is in Santa Cruz California. We\u2019re above any Tsunami levels. Earthquakes are fun here and have never killed anyone. The University of California provides much cultural things to do. The weather is PERFECT year-round and the population low. The Beaches are beautiful, AND you can get everything you need, including our Survival Food. No big cities even close. Xploregon \nIn 2-3 months I\u2019ll have two (2) two (2) acre remote wooded lots available for sale in south/central Oregon (Coos County)for sale (price not yet determined) on a very large fresh water lake about three (3) miles inland from the beach. Currently lake/water access only but may have seasonal road which can be developed to year round if desired. 30+ miles of nothing but deep Pacific NW forest (mostly state forest land)to the East and simular S, N & West. Sportsmans paradise in the \u201cbananna belt\u201d of Oregon. Septic and water well approvable. Badguy \nYes, the Midwest is a rust belt\u2026 but that may be an advantage! We\u2019re ALREADY poor.. so any hard economic times will only be \u201cmore of the same\u201d. Also, there\u2019s plenty of fresh water, woods and ground that can be cultivated easily. Also, it\u2019s hard to hold riots when the temperature is 20 degress F or below (5 months a year). Also, if an when, the government decides that bringing back manufacturing is a must if a military confrontation with China becomes eminent or to avoid a complete social and political collapse, we still have trained workers the can restart the process. Liz Michael \nIn the event of a collapse, you probably want to pick a place or a region which could survive on its own as an independent republic. To me, this means Texas, and any state relatively close to Texas. I am in Arizona, close enough to Texas. In a collapse, illegal immigration may no longer be a problem: no jobs means no immigrants. Phenius Barnham \nKetchum, Idaho. The rest of Idaho is not all that you\u2019d want. The Ski Folk come and spread smiles. Scott and Smith are headquartered here. The Sawtooth Mountains are some of the prettiest in the world and the populace are friendly and educated. Mountains are always the last to attract military. Yellowstone is not going to go off so relax. The homes are all well built and there ain\u2019t no junk. Crime is non-existant because most people have their own money and the poor always have jobs. MICHAELD \nNorthern and North Central Idaho has the advantages of rural life but access to several larger communities in Oregon and Washington, just across the Idaho border in the Panhandle. The Lewiston/Clarkston area at the confluence of the Snake and Clearwater Rivers has a great climate (much warmer than the surrounding higher elevations) and access to any outdoor recreation you can think of. Coeur d\u2019Alene and Post Falls are very close to Spokane. All have great medical facilities. \nJobs are tough to come by, but self employment is a great option for anyone handy with tools. Lots of retired folk live here and they generally have resources to hire things done for them. Acreages are still cheap, too. BMOC \nI live on South Beach. I can eat pole dancers and foreign tourists. And their children. My tinfoil hat will keep me from sunburn. I live near a pharmacy to supply me my Prozac. In case of riots I can club people on their heads with a Cuban sandwich to defend myself. If things get too bad here I can grab onto an old tire and float myself over to the Bahamas. Life will be OK. \nIf you can\u2019t leave your city, then the Urban Survival Guide shows you how to survive during a crisis, and protect yourself and your family. \nDavid",

        "body_en": "Obama Won\u2019t Vote With America at the UN Under Obama, the United States won\u2019t defend the United States. November 1, 2016 Daniel Greenfield \nDaniel Greenfield, a Shillman Journalism Fellow at the Freedom Center, is a New York writer focusing on radical Islam. \nA generation ago the Communist tyranny in Cuba demanded that the United Nations condemn America for the embargo. The brutal Castro regime\u2019s rant accused the United States of threatening \u201cnuclear annihilation,\u201d \u201ccountless acts of sabotage and plans to assassinate Cuban leaders.\u201d \nOn a cold day in October, the European left-wing activist serving as UN Ambassador announced to applause that her administration would no longer be voting to defend the US at the UN. \n\"UN Member States have voted overwhelmingly for a General Assembly resolution that condemns the U.S. embargo and calls for it to be ended. The United States has always voted against this resolution. Today the United States will abstain,\" Samantha Power said. \n\"Thank you,\" she added, acknowledging the applause. \nUnder Obama, the United States would no longer defend the United States. A generation ago the Communists had been in Cuba. Now they were in Washington D.C. \nInstead of defending America, Obama\u2019s chosen representative agreed that our Communist enemies had a point about our lack of human rights and our imperialist foreign policy. \n\u201cLet me be among the first to acknowledge \u2013 as our Cuban counterparts often point out \u2013 that the United States has work to do in fulfilling these rights for our own citizens. And we know that at times in our history, U.S. leaders and citizens used the pretext of promoting democracy and human rights in the region to justify actions that have left a deep legacy of mistrust,\u201d she said. \nIf the Cuban representative had been in her place, he could not have done much better. Communist Cuban propaganda was now being parroted by Ambassador Power. If the Castro dictatorship wanted to save money, it could shut down its propaganda department and outsource the labor to Washington D.C. \nThe Cuban ambassador boasted that Cuban Communists had \u201crid ourselves of US imperialism\u201d and proclaimed that, \u201cWe will never go back to capitalism.\u201d He declared that the resolution was a powerful message to \u201cthe peoples of the world.\u201d The message is indeed unmistakable. \nBen Rhodes, the close Obama adviser who sold the media on the Iran sellout, curtly tweeted his justification, \u201cNo reason to vote to defend a failed policy we oppose.\u201d \nWho is this \u201cwe\u201d? \nThe Cuban embargo is the \u201claw of the land\u201d. It\u2019s the official policy of the United States. It\u2019s based on laws passed by Congress and implemented by President John F. Kennedy and his successors. \nThis \u201cwe\u201d certainly isn\u2019t the United States government, its elected representatives in the legislative and executive branches working together to end the old policy and implement a new one. \nOne member of the \u201cwe\u201d must be Ben Rhodes because he tells us so. Who is Rhodes? An \u201caspiring\u201d novelist who pushed Obama to back the Muslim Brotherhood takeover of Egypt, the Iran nuke sellout and now, apparently, choosing Communist Cuba over America. \nNo one has ever elected Rhodes to anything, but under left-wing rule, he outweighs Congress, President Kennedy, the law of the land and the national interests of the United States. \n\u201cWe\u201d is Obama who made the final decision. It\u2019s Ambassador Samantha Power. It\u2019s a number of other functionaries all of whom derive their power from a single elected official who is only one third of the government. This is the \u201cwe\u201d that announced its treasonous opposition to the US at the UN. \nAmerica has a \u201cwe\u201d problem. \nIf the \u201cwe\u201d of the American left wants to vote its own way, it should secede to form its own country. \nWhen President John F. Kennedy proclaimed the \u201cEmbargo on All Trade with Cuba\u201d, he based it on authorization from \u201cthe Congress of the United States\u201d. That is how our system used to work. \nThese days El Teleprompte in D.C. decides that he wants to sign a nuclear treaty with Iran, mandate transgender bathrooms, legalize millions of illegal aliens or open relations with his brother tyrant in Havana and he does so on his own authority. And Congress is dismissed as a bunch of obstructionists. \nThat\u2019s not how America is supposed to work. That\u2019s how Iran works. That\u2019s how Cuba works. \nThe first word in the introduction to Obama\u2019s Presidential Policy Directive on Cuba after the date was \u201cI\u201d. Obama\u2019s basis for his authority is his 2014 announcement. L'etat c'est moi. Obama is the State. \nJFK, no humble shrinking violet, mentions \u201cI\u201d only in the fourth paragraph, after Congress. What is the context of Kennedy\u2019s \u201cI\u201d? \u201cNow, Therefore, I, John F. Kennedy, President of the United States of America, acting under the authority of section 620(a) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961.\u201d \nThe \u201cI\u201d of JFK can only act as a servant, not a master. \nIn Obama\u2019s \u201cDirective\u201d, Congress exists only to be berated or badgered for its obstructionism. There is no source of authorization for anything other than Barack Obama. There is no law. Only Obama. \nNow the big \u201cwe\u201d in Washington have decided that they will oppose America at the United Nations. But Ben Rhodes, who aspires to excel at novelistic narratives, made an unfortunate slip. Obama has been accused of Louis XIV\u2019s L'etat c'est moi mentality. But Ben Rhodes isn\u2019t saying, \u201cWe are the state\u201d. Instead he tells us that there are two powerful political entities in America. One is US. The other is We. \n\u201cWe\u201d does not yet entirely control the state. But \u201cwe\u201d also feels no obligation to the United States. If \u201cwe\u201d agrees with America, then \u201cwe\u201d will vote with it at the UN. If \u201cwe\u201d opposes America, then \u201cwe\u201d votes against it. \u201cWe\u201d will choose patriotism or treason based on its own interests. Not ours. \n\u201cWe\u201d happens to run America. But it isn\u2019t America. It\u2019s the parasite humped on America\u2019s back. \nYou can call \u201cwe\u201d by many names. Deep State is one. It\u2019s a coalition of left-wing special interests networking through politics, the non-profit sector and media corporations to control America. \nPresident Kennedy was quite familiar with the enemy . \u201cWe are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on covert means for expanding its sphere of influence--on infiltration instead of invasion, on subversion instead of elections, on intimidation instead of free choice.\u201d \nKennedy was speaking after the recent Bay of Pigs crisis. The Foreign Assistance Act, mentioned by him, was passed by Congress that year. While the Cuban embargo limited the ability of the Castro regime to sponsor and spread terror around the region and the world, it didn\u2019t stop the \u201cwe\u201d in Washington D.C. \nIt is easy to sit here in the distant future of 2016 and wonder whether Cuba matters at all. But the truth is that we are still enmeshed in the same fundamental struggle of the Cold War. That struggle did not end when the Berlin Wall fell. It is a battle over whether nations will be ruled by \u201cWe the People\u201d or by the nameless \u201cWe\u201d of the monolithic and ruthless conspiracy of the Nomenklatura of the left. \nBy backing away from America at the United Nations, the \u201cwe\u201d have announced their independence from the laws, responsibilities and duties of the country whose government they have hijacked. \nBut the \u201cwe\u201d offer us no such independence from their treasonous rule. Instead they impose on us the collectivism of Yevgeny Zamyatin's novel \u201cWe\u201d in which everyone suffers under the stifling progressive tyranny of the One State that controls every aspect of human life. That novel inspired 1984. \nWhat \u201cwe\u201d offer us is what Cuba\u2019s Castro, We\u2019s One State and every Communist regime offer us. It's what George Orwell in 1984 summed up as, \u201cA boot stamping on a human face \u2014 forever.\u201d \nPresident Kennedy dated his embargo proclamation from the \u201cone hundred and eighty-sixth\u201d year of \u201cthe Independence of the United States of America.\u201d At the United Nations, Ambassador Power cheerfully declared America\u2019s enforced submission to the Communist demands for Cuba. \nThe Cuban people show no signs of winning independence from their Communist overlords. The question is will the United States of America be able to regain its independence from the \u201cwe\u201d?",

        "body_en": "The Fatal Expense Of American Imperialism\nBy Jeffrey D. Sachs\n Boston Globe \" - THE SINGLE MOST important issue in allocating national resources is war versus peace, or as macroeconomists put it, \u0093guns versus butter.\u0094 The United States is getting this choice profoundly wrong, squandering vast sums and undermining national security. In economic and geopolitical terms, America suffers from what Yale historian Paul Kennedy calls \u0093imperial overreach.\u0094 If our next president remains trapped in expensive Middle East wars, the budgetary costs alone could derail any hopes for solving our vast domestic problems.\nIt may seem tendentious to call America an empire, but the term fits certain realities of US power and how it\u0092s used. An empire is a group of territories under a single power. Nineteenth-century Britain was obviously an empire when it ruled India, Egypt, and dozens of other colonies in Africa, Asia, and the Caribbean. The United States directly rules only a handful of conquered islands (Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Guam, Samoa, the Northern Mariana Islands), but it stations troops and has used force to influence who governs in dozens of other sovereign countries. That grip on power beyond America\u0092s own shores is now weakening.\nThe scale of US military operations is remarkable. The US Department of Defense has (as of a 2010 inventory) 4,999 military facilities, of which 4,249 are in the United States; 88 are in overseas US territories; and 662 are in 36 foreign countries and foreign territories, in all regions of the world. Not counted in this list are the secret facilities of the US intelligence agencies. The cost of running these military operations and the wars they support is extraordinary, around $900 billion per year, or 5 percent of US national income, when one adds the budgets of the Pentagon, the intelligence agencies, homeland security, nuclear weapons programs in the Department of Energy, and veterans benefits. The $900 billion in annual spending is roughly one-quarter of all federal government outlays.\nThe United States has a long history of using covert and overt means to overthrow governments deemed to be unfriendly to US interests, following the classic imperial strategy of rule through locally imposed friendly regimes. In a powerful study of Latin America between 1898 and 1994, for example, historian John Coatsworth counts 41 cases of \u0093successful\u0094 US-led regime change, for an average rate of one government overthrow by the United States every 28 months for a century. And note: Coatsworth\u0092s count does not include the failed attempts, such as the Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba.\nThis tradition of US-led regime change has been part and parcel of US foreign policy in other parts of the world, including Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia. Wars of regime change are costly to the United States, and often devastating to the countries involved. Two major studies have measured the costs of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. One, by my Columbia colleague Joseph Stiglitz and Harvard scholar Linda Bilmes, arrived at the cost of $3 trillion as of 2008. A more recent study, by the Cost of War Project at Brown University, puts the price tag at $4.7 trillion through 2016. Over a 15-year period, the $4.7 trillion amounts to roughly $300 billion per year, and is more than the combined total outlays from 2001 to 2016 for the federal departments of education, energy, labor, interior, and transportation, and the National Science Foundation, National Institutes of Health, and the Environmental Protection Agency.\nIt is nearly a truism that US wars of regime change have rarely served America\u0092s security needs. Even when the wars succeed in overthrowing a government, as in the case of the Taliban in Afghanistan, Saddam Hussein in Iraq, and Moammar Khadafy in Libya, the result is rarely a stable government, and is more often a civil war. A \u0093successful\u0094 regime change often lights a long fuse leading to a future explosion, such as the 1953 overthrow of Iran\u0092s democratically elected government and installation of the autocratic Shah of Iran, which was followed by the Iranian Revolution of 1979. In many other cases, such as the US attempts (with Saudi Arabia and Turkey) to overthrow Syria\u0092s Bashar al-Assad, the result is a bloodbath and military standoff rather than an overthrow of the government.\nWHAT IS THE DEEP motivation for these profligate wars and for the far-flung military bases that support them?\nFrom 1950 to 1990, the superficial answer would have been the Cold War. Yet America\u0092s imperial behavior overseas predates the Cold War by half a century (back to the Spanish-American War, in 1898) and has outlasted it by another quarter century. America\u0092s overseas imperial adventures began after the Civil War and the final conquests of the Native American nations. At that point, US political and business leaders sought to join the European empires \u0097 especially Britain, France, Russia, and the newly emergent Germany \u0097 in overseas conquests. In short order, America grabbed the Philippines, Puerto Rico, Cuba, Panama, and Hawaii, and joined the European imperial powers in knocking on the doors of China.\nAs of the 1890s, the United States was by far the world\u0092s largest economy, but until World War II, it took a back seat to the British Empire in global naval power, imperial reach, and geopolitical dominance. The British were the unrivaled masters of regime change \u0097 for example, in carving up the corpse of the Ottoman Empire after World War I. Yet the exhaustion from two world wars and the Great Depression ended the British and French empires after World War II and thrust the United States and Russia into the forefront as the two main global empires. The Cold War had begun.\nThe economic underpinning of America\u0092s global reach was unprecedented. As of 1950, US output constituted a remarkable 27 percent of global output, with the Soviet Union roughly a third of that, around 10 percent. The Cold War fed two fundamental ideas that would shape American foreign policy till now. The first was that the United States was in a struggle for survival against the Soviet empire. The second was that every country, no matter how remote, was a battlefield in that global war. While the United States and the Soviet Union would avoid a direct confrontation, they flexed their muscles in hot wars around the world that served as proxies for the superpower competition.\nOver the course of nearly a half century, Cuba, Congo, Ghana, Indonesia, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Iran, Namibia, Mozambique, Chile, Afghanistan, Lebanon, and even tiny Granada, among many others, were interpreted by US strategists as battlegrounds with the Soviet empire. Often, far more prosaic interests were involved. Private companies like United Fruit International and ITT convinced friends in high places (most famously the Dulles brothers, Secretary of State John Foster and CIA director Allen) that land reforms or threatened expropriations of corporate assets were dire threats to US interests, and therefore in need of US-led regime change. Oil interests in the Middle East were another repeated cause of war, as had been the case for the British Empire from the 1920s.\nThese wars destabilized and impoverished the countries involved rather than settling the politics in America\u0092s favor. The wars of regime change were, with few exceptions, a litany of foreign policy failure. They were also extraordinarily costly for the United States itself. The Vietnam War was of course the greatest of the debacles, so expensive, so bloody, and so controversial that it crowded out Lyndon Johnson\u0092s other, far more important and promising war, the War on Poverty, in the United States.\nThe end of the Cold War, in 1991, should have been the occasion for a fundamental reorientation of US guns-versus-butter policies. The occasion offered the United States and the world a \u0093peace dividend,\u0094 the opportunity to reorient the world and US economy from war footing to sustainable development. Indeed, the Rio Earth Summit, in 1992, established sustainable development as the centerpiece of global cooperation, or so it seemed.\nAlas, the blinders and arrogance of American imperial thinking prevented the United States from settling down to a new era of peace. As the Cold War was ending, the United States was beginning a new era of wars, this time in the Middle East. The United States would sweep away the Soviet-backed regimes in the Middle East and establish unrivalled US political dominance. Or at least that was the plan.\nTHE QUARTER CENTURY since 1991 has therefore been marked by a perpetual US war in the Middle East, one that has destabilized the region, massively diverted resources away from civilian needs toward the military, and helped to create mass budget deficits and the buildup of public debt. The imperial thinking has led to wars of regime change in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Yemen, Somalia, and Syria, across four presidencies: George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama. The same thinking has induced the United States to expand NATO to Russia\u0092s borders, despite the fact that NATO\u0092s supposed purpose was to defend against an adversary \u0097 the Soviet Union \u0097 that no longer exists. Former Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev has emphasized that eastward NATO expansion \u0093was certainly a violation of the spirit of those declarations and assurances that we were given in 1990,\u0094 regarding the future of East-West security.\nThere is a major economic difference, however, between now and 1991, much less 1950. At the start of the Cold War, in 1950, the United States produced around 27 percent of world output. As of 1991, when the Dick Cheney and Paul Wolfowitz dreams of US dominance were taking shape, the United States accounted for around 22 percent of world production. By now, according to IMF estimates, the US share is 16 percent, while China has surpassed the United States, at around 18 percent. By 2021, according to projections by the International Monetary Fund, the United States will produce roughly 15 percent of global output compared with China\u0092s 20 percent. The United States is incurring massive public debt and cutting back on urgent public investments at home in order to sustain a dysfunctional, militarized, and costly foreign policy.\nThus comes a fundamental choice. The United States can vainly continue the neoconservative project of unipolar dominance, even as the recent failures in the Middle East and America\u0092s declining economic preeminence guarantee the ultimate failure of this imperial vision. If, as some neoconservatives support, the United States now engages in an arms race with China, we are bound to come up short in a decade or two, if not sooner. The costly wars in the Middle East \u0097 even if continued much less enlarged in a Hillary Clinton presidency \u0097 could easily end any realistic hopes for a new era of scaled-up federal investments in education, workforce training, infrastructure, science and technology, and the environment.\nThe far smarter approach will be to maintain America\u0092s defensive capabilities but end its imperial pretensions. This, in practice, means cutting back on the far-flung network of military bases, ending wars of regime change, avoiding a new arms race (especially in next-generation nuclear weapons), and engaging China, India, Russia, and other regional powers in stepped-up diplomacy through the United Nations, especially through shared actions on the UN\u0092s Sustainable Development Goals, including climate change, disease control, and global education.\nMany American conservatives will sneer at the very thought that the United States\u0092 room for maneuver should be limited in the slightest by the UN. But think how much better off the United States would be today had it heeded the UN Security Council\u0092s wise opposition to the wars of regime change in Iraq, Libya, and Syria. Many conservatives will point to Vladimir Putin\u0092s actions in Crimea as proof that diplomacy with Russia is useless, without recognizing that it was NATO\u0092s expansion to the Baltics and its 2008 invitation to Ukraine to join NATO, that was a primary trigger of Putin\u0092s response.\nIn the end, the Soviet Union bankrupted itself through costly foreign adventures such as the 1979 invasion of Afghanistan and its vast over-investment in the military. Today the United States has similarly over-invested in the military, and could follow a similar path to decline if it continues the wars in the Middle East and invites an arms race with China. It\u0092s time to abandon the reveries, burdens, and self-deceptions of empire and to invest in sustainable development at home and in partnership with the rest of the world.\nJeffrey D.
