Socios | 29 de octubre de 2016 por Guillermo Olivera D\u00edaz*\r\n29-10-2016\r\nResulta ilegal, por ende NULA, la elecci\u00f3n de los 3 nuevos directores del BCRP. Tanto la repentina proposici\u00f3n, ante la Junta de Portavoces, como la veloc\u00edsima designaci\u00f3n por el Pleno del Congreso, sin debate alguno, ni examen de requisitos legales, no cumplen las exigencias que expresamente contempla la Ley Org\u00e1nica del Banco.\r\nLa \"reconocida solvencia moral\" y la \"amplia competencia y experiencia en econom\u00eda y finanzas\", requisitos que exige esa Ley, no se presumen o infieren. Deben acreditarse documental e indubitablemente y entrevistando a los propuestos, supuestos que no se han cumplido en ning\u00fan momento y forma.\r\nLa extra\u00f1a propuesta y marat\u00f3nica designaci\u00f3n, de un d\u00eda para otro, viola o infringe lo dispuesto en forma expresa y apod\u00edctica, por la enorme importancia de esta funci\u00f3n p\u00fablica, en el Art\u00edculo 11\u00b0 de la Ley Org\u00e1nica del Banco.\r\nRafael Rey, integr\u00f3 la plancha presidencial de Keiko en el 2011; Jos\u00e9 Chlimper, es secretario general de Fuerza Popular y tambi\u00e9n integr\u00f3 la plancha presidencial del fujimorismo el 2016; y Elmer Cuba, fue casi el \u00fanico vocero econ\u00f3mico en la \u00faltima campa\u00f1a electoral de Fuerza Popular, pese a que visiblemente hab\u00eda militado en otro partido del cual era fundador. Por ende, se trata de personajes parcializados, con apego aluvional partidario y ajenos a los intereses generales y neutrales del Banco Central de Reserva.\r\nTienen los 3 designados una estrecha vinculaci\u00f3n con el fujimorismo y Keiko Fujimori; su designaci\u00f3n, de un d\u00eda de proposici\u00f3n: a las 4 pm, a otro de designaci\u00f3n, luego de una repentina y misteriosa propuesta sin documentos de los propuestos, incumple la letra y esp\u00edritu del citado Art\u00edculo 11\u00b0 de la ley del Banco Central de Reserva.\r\nLo que dice la norma:\r\nArt\u00edculo 11: \u201cLos directores deben ser peruanos, tener reconocida solvencia moral y poseer amplia competencia y experiencia en econom\u00eda y finanzas. No representan a entidad o inter\u00e9s particular alguno y su voto debe tener en cuenta \u00fanicamente el cumplimiento de la finalidad y las funciones del Banco\u201d.\r\nLos tres largamente incumplen esta disposici\u00f3n, pues no se ha establecido debidamente, mediante el escrutinio necesario y documentos del caso, que posean esa reconocida solvencia moral y que tengan no solo competencia o pericia, sino que tengan amplia experiencia en econom\u00eda y finanzas, que solo es posible acreditarlo mediante el examen correspondiente, en un proceso que debe sujetarse al escrutinio congresal y p\u00fablico, lo cual claramente se ha esquivado o escamoteado. Se ha omitido acatar la ley.\r\nAdem\u00e1s, los tres representan claramente los intereses de Fuerza Popular y de Keiko, y eso est\u00e1 muy claro. Su conducta repetida y p\u00fablica lo demuestra hasta la saciedad. Profusas fotos hablan de esta \u00edntima anastomosis partidaria.\r\nLa solvencia moral no se presume, ni consta en el aire, no es gaseosa, debe demostrarse, acreditarse o probarse y con mayor raz\u00f3n si ella debe ser RECONOCIDA por muchos o por todos\r\nIgualmente, la competencia y experiencia en las materias econ\u00f3mica y finanzas no se deducen o se coligen por los dichos de los propios interesados, sino que igualmente deben acreditarse, cosa que no se ha hecho. Resulta as\u00ed absolutamente ilegal esta proposici\u00f3n y designaci\u00f3n de los tres candidatos. Alguien debe impugnar este nombramiento ante el Congreso o ante el Poder Judicial. Lo que viola la ley es pasible de nulidad.\r\nTomado de http://senaldealerta.pe/opini%C3%B3...\r\n* [email protected]",

    "body_en": "A View of the Syrian War From the Golan Heights One Syrian lieutenant described to me how he directed his artillery fire onto an Israeli jeep in the Jabhat al-Nusra occupied town of Al-Hamidiya inside Syria and destroyed it. The jeep might have been a gift or borrowed from Israel\r\nBy Robert Fisk\r\nNovember 10, 2016 \" Information Clearing House \" - \" The Independent \" - From Colonel Saleh\u0092s forward position on his front line north of Quneitra, he has a unique and exclusive view of the Syrian war. To his west and south is a vast area of his country which is occupied by Jabhat al-Nusra Islamist fighters \u0096 their earthen ramparts and supply roads are scarcely half a mile away. Then, another couple of miles away, Israeli soldiers are inside their concrete positions on the occupied Syrian Golan Heights, above the old and Nusra-held Syrian city of Quneitra.\r\n\u0093You see that mosque over there, just to the right of the water tower?\u0094 the colonel asks. \u0093Well, Nusra is there. And you see the triangular hill beyond? The Israelis are there.\u0094 It\u0092s what you call a politically intriguing battlefield \u0096 yes, shells do come whizzing in towards the Syrians from Nusra and also from the Israelis. The Syrians concentrate their fire on Nusra but Nusra\u0092s casualties are often taken through the Israeli lines for hospital treatment in Haifa.\r\nSo whose side is Israel on? Baath City is a concrete conurbation created back in pre-civil war days to defy the vandalisation of the old Quenitra. It was occupied by the Israeli army during the 1973 Middle East war and then \u0096 before they abandoned it under the Kissinger agreement \u0096 totally destroyed with explosives by Israeli troops. Nusra now occupy these 43-year old ruins. As for Baath City, its university, banks, fire station, schools, police force and hospitals are defiantly maintained by the Syrians under the eyes of their two enemies: the Nusra Islamists and the Israelis.\r\nAccording to the Syrian army in Baath City \u0096 their forward lines and tanks are positioned in unfinished apartment blocks on the edge of the town \u0096 their intelligence department\u0092s Hebrew speakers constantly monitor conversations between the Israelis and between Israeli and Nusra fighters. They know \u0096 and the Israelis have made no secret of the fact \u0096 that wounded Nusrah fighters are taken to Haifa for hospital treatment. On one occasion, a Nusrah man travelling in an Israeli ambulance on the Golan was dragged from the vehicle and lynched by a crowd of enraged Druze men who are largely loyal to the Syrian government and regard Nusrah as their mortal enemies. Reports of the man\u0092s murder highlighted the highly ambiguous relationship between Israel and the Islamists, whose name-changing cannot conceal their al-Qaeda roots.\r\nDruze towns inside Syria and close to Baath City have taken the side of the regime \u0096 this does not apply to other Druze areas \u0096 but it makes the geography of the front line here all the more surreal. One Syrian lieutenant described to me how he directed his artillery fire onto an Israeli jeep in the Nusra-occupied town of Al-Hamidiya inside Syria and destroyed it. The jeep might have been a gift or borrowed from Israel \u0096 whether there were any Israeli personnel inside it if it was hit is another matter. The Syrians, however, also say that Israeli bulldozers were used to build a new supply route for Nusrah between Quneitra and Golan \u0096 again, inside Syria\u0092s frontiers.\r\nAll of which raises a compelling question. The Nusra-controlled territory between the Syrians and the Israeli lines on Golan \u0096 and other Islamist groups and a few remnants of the old \u0093Free Syrian Army\u0094 allied to them in this location \u0096 stretches all the way south to the edge of the Syrian city of Deraa and right down to the Jordanian frontier. And beyond that frontier is the so-called \u0093Military Operations Centre\u0094 \u0096 the \u0093MOC\u0094 of which both the Islamists and the Syrian army refer \u0096 where Western intelligence officers maintain a liaison and weapons supply depot for the anti-government Syrian forces.\r\nSo what is the relationship between the MOC and its Western backers \u0096 who maintain contact with Nusra \u0096 and the Israelis who treat Nusra\u0092s wounded in their hospitals? The Jordanian border and the Israeli lines on Golan are at their most only about 70 miles apart and opposition fighters hold all the land in between.\r\nLittered around the front lines outside Baath City are the wreckage of past battles and the abandoned UN posts from which Filipino UN soldiers were kidnapped en masse more than a year ago; the Syrian army now occupies several of these positions, the UN logo still painted on the walls although several of the \u0093igloo\u0094-type UN accommodation huts have migrated to Syrian compounds in the rear lines. The UN force on Golan now operates only inside Israeli-occupied territory.\r\nOnly a few hundred yards away from Nusra-held territory, we found Abu Hashem, a farmer who fled from his village, now held by the Islamists, living today in family property close to one of the old UN posts. He fed us tea and coffee and walnuts from his orchard. His wife and six children now exist in this unfinished, cold house along with a small library of books \u0096 the speeches of Imam Ali (the \u0093Najul Blagha\u0094) and a collection of medical books of Aleppo herbal cures for headaches and kidney infection, published in Beirut. He says the people in his Nusra-occupied village are divided. Some are sympathetic towards the Islamists \u0096 they are not fighters \u0096 while others are sometimes permitted by Nusrah to cross the front lines for treatment in Syrian government hospitals. They are Bedouins and farmers, the unsettled and the landowners, always prey to the wolves of civil war insurgents.\r\nColonel Saleh, who is 50 years old, has been guarding his echoing and weed-strewn apartment blocks on the edge of Baath City for three years, noting wearily that the Israelis attack his army but never attack Nusra who \u0096 being al-Qaeda \u0096 might logically have earned Israel\u0092s enmity. But no. \u0093I know every stone here,\u0094 the colonel says. \u0093I can see if a rock or a vehicle has moved across the fields in front of us \u0096 and I can immediately see if one vehicle has become two vehicles. We know when they are going to attack \u0096 they always precede their offensives with a big artillery and mortar barrage.\u0094\r\nSometimes the voices of Nusra men shout insults at the Syrians on their own radio sets, calling them \u0093kafirs\u0094 \u0096 \u0091\u0093infidels\u0094 or \u0093unbelievers\u0094. \u0093If I am in a good mood, I invite them for coffee,\u0094 Colonel Saleh says. \u0093If I\u0092m in a bad mood, I am silent. Their accents are very similar to the Jordanians. They come from the south of Deraa, along the Jordanian border.\u0094\r\nAs we spoke, further down the line, the Syrians and Nusra were fighting with tanks, artillery and mortars. The Syrians claimed that their enemies arrived in several directions in a convoy of at least 13 vehicles. They spoke, too, of a Nusra female officer called Souad al-Qatahani (nicknamed \u0093Al-Nood\u0094), the 30-year-old sister of a Nusrah general called Qais al-Omani who commanded 1,200 fighters. She was, they pointed out rather remarkably, a former first lieutenant in their own Syrian government army.\r\nAnd one further feature that the Syrians have noted about their enemies outside Baath City. Whenever Nusra fire a missile, they have to take a photograph of the rocket leaving its launcher \u0096 presumably to prove to their suppliers that they have not sold the weapon to someone else. Trust, as usual in the Syrian war, is in short supply.",

    "body_en": "Why Is the Foreign Policy Establishment Spoiling for More War? Look at Their Donors. By Dennis Kucinich\r\n The Nation \" - W ashington, DC, may be the only place in the world where people openly flaunt their pseudo-intellectuality by banding together, declaring themselves \u0093think tanks,\u0094 and raising money from external interests, including foreign governments, to compile reports that advance policies inimical to the real-life concerns of the American people.\r\nAs a former member of the House of Representatives, I remember 16 years of congressional hearings where pedigreed experts came to advocate wars in testimony based on circular, rococo thinking devoid of depth, reality, and truth. I remember other hearings where the Pentagon was unable to reconcile over $1 trillion in accounts, lost track of $12 billion in cash sent to Iraq, and rigged a missile-defense test so that an interceptor could easily home in on a target. War is first and foremost a profitable racket.\r\nHow else to explain that in the past 15 years this city\u0092s so called bipartisan foreign policy elite has promoted wars in Iraq and Libya, and interventions in Syria and Yemen, which have opened Pandora\u0092s box to a trusting world, to the tune of trillions of dollars, a windfall for military contractors. DC\u0092s think \u0093tanks\u0094 should rightly be included in the taxonomy of armored war vehicles and not as gathering places for refugees from academia.\r\nAccording to the front page of this past Friday\u0092s Washington Post , the bipartisan foreign-policy elite recommends the next president show less restraint than President Obama. Acting at the urging of \u0093liberal\u0094 hawks brandishing humanitarian intervention, read war, the Obama administration attacked Libya along with allied powers working through NATO.\r\nThe think tankers fell in line with the Iraq invasion. Not being in the tank, I did my own analysis of the call for war in October of 2002, based on readily accessible information, and easily concluded that there was no justification for war. I distributed it widely in Congress and led 125 Democrats in voting against the Iraq war resolution. There was no money to be made from a conclusion that war was uncalled for, so, against millions protesting in the United States and worldwide, our government launched into an abyss, with a lot of armchair generals waving combat pennants. The marching band and chowder society of DC think tanks learned nothing from the Iraq and Libya experience.\r\nThe only winners were arms dealers, oil companies, and jihadists. Immediately after the fall of Libya, the black flag of Al Qaeda was raised over a municipal building in Benghazi, Gadhafi\u0092s murder was soon to follow, with Secretary Clinton quipping with a laugh, \u0093We came, we saw, he died.\u0094 President Obama apparently learned from this misadventure, but not the Washington policy establishment, which is spoiling for more war.\r\nThe self-identified liberal Center for American Progress (CAP) is now calling for Syria to be bombed, and estimates America\u0092s current military adventures will be tidied up by 2025, a tardy twist on \u0093mission accomplished.\u0094 CAP, according to a report in The Nation , has received funding from war contractors Lockheed Martin and Boeing, who make the bombers that CAP wants to rain hellfire on Syria.\r\nThe Brookings Institute has taken tens of millions from foreign governments , notably Qatar, a key player in the military campaign to oust Assad. Retired four-star Marine general John Allen is now a Brookings senior fellow . Charles Lister is a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute , which has received funding from Saudi Arabia , the major financial force providing billions in arms to upend Assad and install a Sunni caliphate stretching across Iraq and Syria. Foreign-government money is driving our foreign policy.\r\nAs the drumbeat for an expanded war gets louder, Allen and Lister jointly signed an op-ed in the Sunday Washington Post , calling for an attack on Syria. The Brookings Institute, in a report to Congress , admitted it received $250,000 from the US Central Command, Centcom, where General Allen shared leadership duties with General David Petraeus. Pentagon money to think tanks that endorse war? This is academic integrity, DC-style.\r\nAnd why is Central Command, as well as the Food and Drug Administration, the US Department of transportation, and the US Department of Health and Human Services giving money to Brookings ?\r\nFormer secretary of state Madeleine Albright, who famously told Colin Powell , \u0093What\u0092s the point of having this superb military you\u0092re always talking about if we can\u0092t use it,\u0094 predictably says of this current moment , \u0093We do think there needs to be more American action.\u0094 A former Bush administration top adviser is also calling for the United States to launch a cruise missile attack on Syria.\r\nThe American people are fed up with war, but a concerted effort is being made through fearmongering, propaganda, and lies to prepare our country for a dangerous confrontation, with Russia in Syria.\r\nThe demonization of Russia is a calculated plan to resurrect a r aison d\u0092\u0119tre for stone-cold warriors trying to escape from the dustbin of history by evoking the specter of Russian world domination.\r\nIt\u0092s infectious. Earlier this year the BBC broadcast a fictional show that contemplated WWIII, beginning with a Russian invasion of Latvia (where 26 percent of the population is ethnic Russian and 34 percent of Latvians speak Russian at home).\r\nThe imaginary WWIII scenario conjures Russia\u0092s targeting London for a nuclear strike. No wonder that by the summer of 2016 a poll showed two-thirds of UK citizens approved the new British PM\u0092s launching a nuclear strike in retaliation. So much for learning the lessons detailed in the Chilcot report.\r\nAs this year\u0092s presidential election comes to a conclusion, the Washington ideologues are regurgitating the same bipartisan consensus that has kept America at war since 9/11 and made the world a decidedly more dangerous place.\r\nThe DC think tanks provide cover for the political establishment, a political safety net, with a fictive analytical framework providing a moral rationale for intervention, capitol casuistry. I\u0092m fed up with the DC policy elite who cash in on war while presenting themselves as experts, at the cost of other people\u0092s lives, our national fortune, and the sacred honor of our country.\r\nAny report advocating war that comes from any alleged think tank ought to be accompanied by a list of the think tank\u0092s sponsors and donors and a statement of the lobbying connections of the report\u0092s authors.\r\nIt is our patriotic duty to expose why the DC foreign-policy establishment and its sponsors have not learned from their failures and instead are repeating them, with the acquiescence of the political class and sleepwalkers with press passes.\r\nIt is also time for a new peace movement in America, one that includes progressives and libertarians alike, both in and out of Congress, to organize on campuses, in cities, and towns across America, to serve as an effective counterbalance to the Demuplican war party, its think tanks, and its media cheerleaders. The work begins now, not after the Inauguration. We must not accept war as inevitable, and those leaders who would lead us in that direction, whether in Congress or the White House, must face visible opposition.\r\nDennis Kucinich, a former Chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, represented Ohio's 10th District from 1997 to 2013.

    "body_en": "NATO Announces Largest Troop Deployments Against Russia Since Cold War By Alex Lantier\r\nNovember 09, 2016 \" Information Clearing House \" - \" WSWS \" - NATO will place hundreds of thousands of troops on alert for military action against Russia in the coming months, top NATO officials told the Times of London on Monday.\r\nThe US-led military alliance is planning to speed up the mobilization of forces numbering in the tens of thousands and, ultimately, hundreds of thousands and millions that are to be mobilized against Russia. Beyond its existing 5,000-strong emergency response force, NATO is tripling its \u0093incumbent response force\u0094 to 40,000 and putting hundreds of thousands of troops on higher alert levels.\r\nThe Times wrote, \u0093Sir Adam West, Britain\u0092s outgoing permanent representative to NATO, said he thought that the goal was to speed up the response time of up to 300,000 military personnel to about two months. At present a force of this size could take up to 180 days to deploy.\u0094\r\nNATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said, \u0093We are addressing what we call the follow-on forces. There are a large number of people in the armed forces of NATO allies. We are looking into how more of them can be ready on a shorter notice.\u0094 According to the Times , Stoltenberg explained that NATO is looking broadly at methods for \u0093improving the readiness of many of the alliance's three million soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines.\u0094\r\nThe target of these deployments, the largest since the dissolution of the Soviet Union by the Stalinist bureaucracy and the end of the Cold War a quarter century ago, is Russia.\r\n\u0093We have seen a more assertive Russia implementing a substantial military build-up of many years, tripling defence spending since 2000 in real terms; developing new military capabilities; exercising their forces and using military force against neighbours,\u0094 Stoltenberg said. \u0093We have also seen Russia using propaganda in Europe among NATO allies and that is exactly the reason why NATO is responding. We are responding with the biggest reinforcement of our collective defence since the end of the Cold War.\u0094\r\nThese statements show how NATO planning for a horrific war against Russia has continued behind the backs of the people throughout the US presidential election campaign. Military deployments and war preparations by the Pentagon and the general staffs of the various European countries are set to go ahead, moreover, whatever the outcome of the election in the United States and those slated for 2017 in the European NATO countries.\r\nStoltenberg's vague attack on Russian \u0093propaganda\u0094 in Europe is an allusion to the instinctive opposition to war that exists in the European and international working class and popular distrust of the anti-Russian propaganda promoted by NATO officials like Stoltenberg and West.\r\nLast year, a Pew poll found broad international opposition to NATO participation in a conventional war against Russia in Eastern Europe, even in a scenario that assumes Russia started the conflict. Under these hypothetical conditions, 58 percent of Germans, 53 percent of French people, and 51 percent of Italians opposed any military action against Russia. Opposition to war in the poll would doubtless have been higher had pollsters mentioned that NATO's decision to attack Russian forces in Eastern Europe could lead to nuclear war.\r\nThis opposition is rooted in deep disaffection with the imperialist Middle East wars of the post-Soviet period and the memory of two world wars in Europe in the 20th century. The arguments Stoltenberg presented against it are politically fraudulent.\r\nThe primary threat of military aggression and war in Europe comes not from Russia, but from the NATO countries. Over the past 25 years, the imperialist powers of NATO have bombed and invaded countries in Central Asia, the Middle East and Africa. Within Europe, they bombed Serbia and Kosovo in the Balkan Wars of the 1990s, pushed NATO\u0092s borders hundreds of miles to the East, and backed a violent, fascist-led putsch to topple a pro-Russian government in Ukraine in 2014.\r\nThe aggressive character of NATO policy emerged once again last Friday, when NBC News reported that US cyber warfare units had hacked key Russian electricity, Internet and military networks. These are now \u0093vulnerable to attack by secret American cyber weapons should the US deem it necessary,\u0094 NBC stated.\r\nRussian officials denounced the activities highlighted in the report and the Obama White House's silence on the matter. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said, \u0093If no official reaction from the American administration follows, it would mean state cyber terrorism exists in the US. If the threats of the attack, which were published by the US media, are carried out, Moscow would be justified in charging Washington.\u0094\r\nThe geo-strategically disastrous consequences of the Stalinist bureaucracy's dissolution of the Soviet Union and restoration of capitalism in Eastern Europe are ever more apparent. With NATO troops or proxy forces stationed in a geographic belt extending from the Baltic republics to Poland, Ukraine and Romania\u0097either a short distance from or on Russia's borders\u0097NATO is now poised for a major war against Russia that could escalate into a nuclear conflagration.\r\nAn examination of Stoltenberg\u0092s remarks shows that NATO\u0092s plans are not defensive preparations to counter a sudden conventional invasion of Europe by the Russian army. In such a scenario, Russian tank columns would overrun the few thousand or tens of thousands of troops in NATO\u0092s various emergency response forces, depriving the broader ranks of NATO \u0093follow-up\u0094 forces the 60 to 180 days they need to mobilize.\r\nRather, the plan for mobilizing successive layers of \u0093follow-on forces\u0094 is intended to allow NATO to threaten Russia in a crisis situation by gradually bringing to bear more and more of its collective military strength, which, although split between 28 member states, outweighs that of Russia. Russia's population of 145 million is far smaller than that of the NATO countries, at 906 million.\r\nThe aggressive character of NATO\u0092s agenda is illustrated by a report issued last month by the CIA-linked Rand Corporation think tank on the military situation in the Baltic republics of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. The small military forces NATO has posted in the Baltic republics, Rand wrote, are \u0093inviting a devastating war, rather than deterring it.\u0094 They calculated that Russian forces, if they actually invaded, could overrun these countries in approximately 60 hours.\r\nOn this basis, the think tank called for launching a vast NATO military build-up in the Baltic republics, virtually at the gates of St. Petersburg. It wrote that it would take \u0093a force of about seven brigades, including three heavy armored brigades\u0097adequately supported by air power, land-based fires, and other enablers on the ground and ready to fight at the onset of hostilities to prevent the rapid overrun of the Baltic states.\u0094 This would cost the NATO countries $2.7 billion each year.\r\nAs the NATO countries intensify their threats against Russia, there are increasingly bitter conflicts among the NATO imperialist powers themselves. Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi bluntly opposed new sanctions on Russia as called for by Washington at last month's European Union summit in Brussels, and there are deepening tensions between Germany and the United States as officials in Berlin and Paris call for an independent EU military.\r\nProspects of increased US-led military provocations against Russia are sharpening tensions within Europe. In an article titled \u0093Whether Clinton or Trump wins, for Germany things will get uncomfortable,\u0094 German news magazine Der Spiegel warned of the long-term implications of an aggressive US-led policy against Russia, which it assumed would continue regardless which of the two candidates secured the White House.\r\nThe magazine wrote, \u0093The motto will be: If you want (nuclear) US protection from Putin, you must either pay us more money or re-arm yourself.\u0094\r\nCopyright \u0160 1998-2016 World Socialist Web Site - All rights reserved",

    "body_en": "Here's something interesting from The Unz Review... Recipient Name Recipient Email => \r\nFormer Washington Post film critic Stephen Hunter has a depiction of \u201cThe Narrative\u201d in one of his novels. Now, here\u2019s former New York Times entertainment industry reporter Michael Cieply with some interesting observations on The Narrative at the NYT . From Deadline : \r\nby Michael Cieply November 10, 2016 12:59pm \r\nIt\u2019s been a moment for soul-searching, and to some extent repentance, at the New York Times. In much-discussed remarks to his own media columnist James Rutenberg, executive editor Dean Baquet offered a mea culpa for having missed the Donald Trump surprise, though he spoke less for the paper than for journalists in general. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to do a much better job of being on the road, out in the country, talking to different kinds of people than we talk to \u2014 especially if you happen to be a New York-based news organization \u2014 and remind ourselves that New York is not the real world,\u201d Baquet said. \r\n\u2026 \u201cAs The Times begins a period of self-reflection, I hope its editors will think hard about the half of America the paper too seldom covers,\u201d wrote Spayd. \r\nShe continued: \u201cThe red state America campaign coverage that rang the loudest in news coverage grew out of Trump rallies, and it often amplified the voices of the most hateful. One especially compelling video produced with footage collected over months on the campaign trail, captured the ugly vitriol like few others. That\u2019s important coverage. \r\nOr it\u2019s intentionally misleading. \r\nBut it and pieces like it drowned out the kind of agenda-free, deep narratives that could have taken Times readers deeper into the lives and values of the people who just elected the next president.\u201d \r\nHaving left the Times on July 25, after almost 12 years as an editor and correspondent, I missed the main heat of the presidential campaign; so I can\u2019t add a word to those self-assessments of the recent political coverage. But these recent mornings-after leave me with some hard-earned thoughts about the Times\u2019 drift from its moorings in the nation at-large. \r\nFor starters, it\u2019s important to accept that the New York Times has always \u2014 or at least for many decades \u2014 been a far more editor-driven, and self-conscious, publication than many of those with which it competes. Historically, the Los Angeles Times, where I worked twice, for instance, was a reporter-driven, bottom-up newspaper. Most editors wanted to know, every day, before the first morning meeting: \u201cWhat are you hearing? What have you got?\u201d \r\nIt was a shock on arriving at the New York Times in 2004, as the paper\u2019s movie editor, to realize that its editorial dynamic was essentially the reverse. By and large, talented reporters scrambled to match stories with what internally was often called \u201cthe narrative.\u201d We were occasionally asked to map a narrative for our various beats a year in advance, square the plan with editors, then generate stories that fit the pre-designated line. \r\nReality usually had a way of intervening. But I knew one senior reporter who would play solitaire on his computer in the mornings, waiting for his editors to come through with marching orders. Once, in the Los Angeles bureau, I listened to a visiting National staff reporter tell a contact, more or less: \u201cMy editor needs someone to say such-and-such, could you say that?\u201d \r\nThe bigger shock came on being told, at least twice, by Times editors who were describing the paper\u2019s daily Page One meeting: \u201cWe set the agenda for the country in that room.\u201d \r\nYou can see this in agenda-driven stuff like World War T and the Military / Campus Rape Culture hysterics. These are not news, they are planned campaigns of psychological warfare.",

    "body_en": "The Fight Isn\u0092t Against ISIS, It\u0092s Against Assad A collection of thoughts about American foreign policy By William Blum\r\nNovember 09, 2016 \" Information Clearing House \" - Louis XVI needed a revolution, Napoleon needed two historic military defeats, the Spanish Empire in the New World needed multiple revolutions, the Russian Czar needed a communist revolution, the Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman Empires needed World War I, Nazi Germany needed World War II, Imperial Japan needed two atomic bombs, the Portuguese Empire in Africa needed a military coup at home, the Soviet Empire needed Mikhail Gorbachev What will the American Empire need?\r\n\u0093I don\u0092t believe anyone will consciously launch World War III. The situation now is more like the eve of World War I, when great powers were armed and ready to go when an incident set things off. Ever since Gorbachev naively ended the Cold War, the hugely over-armed United States has been actively surrounding Russia with weapons systems, aggressive military exercises, NATO expansion. At the same time, in recent years the demonization of Vladimir Putin has reached war propaganda levels. Russians have every reason to believe that the United States is preparing for war against them, and are certain to take defensive measures. This mixture of excessive military preparations and propaganda against an \u0093evil enemy\u0094 make it very easy for some trivial incident to blow it all up.\u0094 \u0096 Diana Johnstone, author of \u0093Queen of Chaos: The Misadventures of Hillary Clinton\u0094\r\nIn September 2013 President Obama stood before the United Nations General Assembly and declared, \u0093I believe America is exceptional.\u0094 The following year at the UN, the president classified Russia as one of the three threats to the world along with the Islamic State and the ebola virus. On March 9, 2015 President Barack Obama declared Venezuela \u0093an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States\u0094.\r\nVladimir Putin, speaking at the UN in 2015, addressing the United States re its foreign policy: \u0093Do you realize what you have done?\u0094\r\nSince the end of World War 2, the United States has:\r\nAttempted to overthrow more than 50 foreign governments, most of which were democratically-elected. Dropped bombs on the people of more than 30 countries. Attempted to assassinate more than 50 foreign leaders. Attempted to suppress a populist or nationalist movement in 20 countries. Grossly interfered in democratic elections in at least 30 countries.* Plus although not easily quantified has been more involved in the practice of torture than any other country in the world for over a century not just performing the actual torture, but teaching it, providing the manuals, and furnishing the equipment. *See chapter 18 of William Blum, \u0093Rogue State: A Guide to the World\u0092s Only Superpower\u0094\r\nOn October 28, 2016 Russia was voted off the UN Human Rights Council. At the same time Saudi Arabia won a second term, uncontested. Does anyone know George Orwell\u0092s email address?\r\nA million refugee from Washington\u0092s warfare are currently over-running Europe. They\u0092re running from Afghanistan and Iraq; from Libya and Somalia; from Syria and Pakistan.\r\nGermany is taking in many Syrian refugees because of its World War Two guilt. What will the United States do in the future because of its guilt? But Americans are not raised to feel such guilt.\r\n\u0093The Plan is for the United States to rule the world. The overt theme is unilateralism, but it is ultimately a story of domination. It calls for the United States to maintain its overwhelming superiority and prevent new rivals from rising up to challenge it on the world stage. It calls for dominion over friends and enemies alike. It says not that the United States must be more powerful, or most powerful, but that it must be absolutely powerful.\u0094 Vice-President Dick Cheney \u0096 West Point lecture, June 2002\r\nTwo flew over the cuckoo\u0092s nest: \u0093We are, as a matter of empirical fact and undeniable history, the greatest force for good the world has ever known. security and freedom for millions of people around the globe have depended on America\u0092s military , economic, political, and diplomatic might.\u0094 \u0096 Dick Cheney and Liz Cheney, \u0093Why the world needs a powerful America\u0094 (2015)\r\nState Department spokesperson Mark Toner: \u0093Assad must go even if Syria goes with him.\u0094\r\nMany of the moves the Obama administration has made in terms of its Cuba policy are in lockstep with Bill Clinton\u0092s, as expressed in the recommendations of a 1999 task force report from the Council on Foreign Relations. The report asserted that \u0093no change in policy should have the primary effect of consolidating, or appearing to legitimize, the political status quo on the island.\u0094\r\nA successful American regime change operation in Syria would cut across definite interests of the Russian state. These include the likely use of Syria as a new pipeline route to bring gas from Qatar to the European market, thereby undercutting Gazprom, Russia\u0092s largest corporation and biggest exporter. Assad\u0092s refusal to consider such a route played no small role in Qatar\u0092s pouring billions of dollars in arms and funds into the Syrian civil war on behalf of anti-Assad forces.\r\n\u0093War with Russia will be nuclear. Washington has prepared for it. Washington has abandoned the ABM treaty, created what it thinks is an ABM shield, and changed its war doctrine to permit US nuclear first strike. All of this is obviously directed at Russia, and the Russian government knows it. How long will Russia sit there waiting for Washington\u0092s first strike?\u0094 \u0096 Paul Craig Roberts, 2014\r\nIran signed the nuclear accords with the United States earlier this year by agreeing to stop what it never was doing. Any Iranian nuclear ambition, real or imagined, is of course a result of American hostility towards Iran, and not the other way around.\r\nIf the European Union were an independent and rational government it would absolutely forbid any member country from stockpiling American nuclear weapons or hosting a US anti-ballistic missile site or any other military base anywhere close to Russia\u0092s borders.\r\nFull Spectrum Dominance, a term the Pentagon loves to use to refer to total control of the planet: land, sea, air, space, outer space and cyberspace. Can you imagine any other country speaking this way?\r\nHenry Kissinger at the Paris Peace Talks, September 1970. \u0093I refuse to believe that a little fourth rate power like North Vietnam does not have a breaking point.\u0094\r\nIn 2010, WikiLeaks released a cable sent to US embassies by then- Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. She wrote this: \u0093Saudi Arabia remains a critical financial support for Al Qaeda, the Taliban, al Nusra and other terrorist groups worldwide.\u0094 Surely this resulted in at least Washington\u0092s much-favored weapon: sanctions of various kinds. It did not.\r\nUS General Barry McCaffrey, April 2015: \u0093Because so far NATO\u0092s reaction to Putin\u0092s aggression has been to send a handful of forces to the Baltics to demonstrate \u0091resolve,\u0092 which has only convinced Putin that the alliance is either unable or unwilling to fight. So we had better change his calculus pretty soon, and contest Putin\u0092s stated doctrine that he is willing to intervene militarily in other countries to \u0091protect\u0092 Russia-speaking people. For God\u0092s sake, the last time we heard that was just before Hitler invaded the Sudetenland.\u0094\r\n No, my dear general, we heard that repeatedly in 1983 when the United States invaded the tiny nation of Grenada to protect and rescue hundreds of Americans who supposedly were in danger from the new leftist government. It was all a fraud, no more than an excuse to overthrow a government that that didn\u0092t believe that the American Empire was God\u0092s gift to humanity.\r\nSince 1980, the United States has intervened in the affairs of fourteen Muslim countries, at worst invading or bombing them. They are (in chronological order) Iran, Libya, Lebanon, Kuwait, Iraq, Somalia, Bosnia, Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, Sudan, Kosovo, Yemen, Pakistan, and now Syria.\r\nHow our never-ending mideast horror began: Radio Address of George W. Bush, September 28, 2002: \u0093The Iraqi regime possesses biological and chemical weapons, is rebuilding the facilities to make more and, according to the British government, could launch a biological or chemical attack in as little as 45 minutes after the order is given. The regime has long-standing and continuing ties to terrorist groups, and there are al Qaeda terrorists inside Iraq. This regime is seeking a nuclear bomb, and with fissile material could build one within a year.\u0094 Yet just six weeks before 9/11, Condoleezza Rice told CNN: \u0093Let\u0092s remember that his [Saddam\u0092s] country is divided, in effect. He does not control the northern part of his country. We are able to keep his arms from him. His military forces have not been rebuilt.\u0094\r\nThe fact is that there is more participation by the Cuban population in the running of their country than there is by the American population in the running of theirs. One important reason is the absence of the numerous private corporations which, in the United States, exert great influence over all aspects of life.\r\n\u0093The U.S. is frantically surrounding China with military weapons, advanced aircraft, naval fleets and a multitude of military bases from Japan, South Korea and the Philippines through several nearby smaller Pacific islands to its new and enlarged base in Australia The U.S. naval fleet, aircraft carriers and nuclear submarines patrol China\u0092s nearby waters. Warplanes, surveillance planes, drones and spying satellites cover the skies, creating a symbolic darkness at noon.\u0094 (Jack A. Smith, \u0093Hegemony Games: USA vs. PRC\u0094, CounterPunch)\r\nCrimea had never voluntarily left Russia. The USSR\u0092s leader Nikita Khrushchev, a native of the region, had donated Crimea to Ukraine in 1954. Crimeans were always strongly opposed to that change and voted overwhelmingly to rejoin Russia after the US-induced Ukrainian coup in 2014. Russian President Vladimir Putin refers to the Ukrainian army as \u0093NATO\u0092s foreign legion\u0094, which does not pursue Ukraine\u0092s national interests. The United States, however, insists on labeling the Russian action in Crimea as an invasion.\r\nPutin re Crimea/Ukraine: \u0093Our western partners created the \u0091Kosovo precedent\u0092 with their own hands. In a situation absolutely the same as the one in Crimea they recognized Kosovo\u0092s secession from Serbia legitimate while arguing that no permission from a country\u0092s central authority for a unilateral declaration of independence is necessary And the UN International Court of Justice agreed with those arguments. That\u0092s what they said; that\u0092s what they trumpeted all over the world and coerced everyone to accept \u0096 and now they are complaining about Crimea. Why is that?\u0094\r\nPaul Craig Roberts: \u0093The absurdity of it all! Even a moron knows that if Russia is going to put tanks and troops into Ukraine, Russia will put in enough to do the job. The war would be over in a few days if not in a few hours. As Putin himself said some months ago, if the Russian military enters Ukraine, the news will not be the fate of Donetsk or Mauriupol, but the fall of Kiev and Lviv.\u0094\r\nIn a major examination of US policy vis-\u0155-vis China, published in March 2015, the authoritative Council on Foreign Relations bluntly declared that \u0093there is no real prospect of building fundamental trust, \u0091peaceful coexistence,\u0092 \u0091mutual understanding,\u0092 a strategic partnership, or a \u0091new type of major country relations\u0092 between the United States and China.\u0094 The United States, the report declares, must, therefore, develop \u0093the political will\u0094 and military capabilities \u0093to deal with China to protect vital U.S. interests.\u0094\r\n\u0093John F. Kennedy changed the mission of the Latin American military from \u0091hemispheric defense\u0092 \u0096 an outdated relic of World War II \u0096 to \u0091internal security,\u0092 which means war against the domestic population.\u0094 \u0096 Noam Chomsky\r\nCuban baseball players who are paid a million dollars to play for an American team are not \u0093defectors\u0094, a word which has a clear political connotation.\r\nBoris Yeltsin was acceptable to American and Europeans because he was seen as a weak, pliable figure that allowed Western capital free rein in the newly opened Russian territory following the collapse of the Soviet Union. Yeltsin\u0092s era was also a time of rampant corruption by Russian oligarchs who were closely associated with Western capital. That corrosive culture came to a halt with the election of Vladimir Putin twice as president between 2000-2008, and again in 2012.\r\nMany ISIS leaders were former Iraqi military officers who were imprisoned by American troops. The fight isn\u0092t against ISIS, it\u0092s against Assad; at the next level it isn\u0092t against Assad, it\u0092s against Putin; then, at the next level, it isn\u0092t against Putin, it\u0092s against the country most likely to stand in the way of US world domination, Russia. And it\u0092s forever.\r\nConnecting to the US-based Internet would mean channeling all of Cuba\u0092s communications directly to the NSA.\r\nGeorge W. Bush has been living a comparatively quiet life in Texas, with a focus on his paintings. \u0093I\u0092m trying to leave something behind\u0094, he said a couple of years ago. Yeah, right, George. We can stand up some of the paintings against the large piles of Iraqi dead bodies.\r\nSeymour Hersh: \u0093America would be much better off, if, 30 years ago, we had let Russia continue its war in Afghanistan The mistake was made by the Carter administration which was trying to stop the Russians from their invasion of Afghanistan. We\u0092d be better off had we let the Russians beat the Taliban.\u0094 ( Deutsche Welle , April 2, 2014 interview) We\u0092d be even better off if we hadn\u0092t overthrown the progressive, secular Afghan government, giving rise to the Taliban in the first place and inciting the Russians to intervene on their border lest the Soviet Islamic population was stirred up.\r\nThe former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright in an interview in 1998 summed up exactly what the US thinks of the UN: \u0093The UN plays a very important role. But if we don\u0092t like it, we always have the option of following our own national security interests, which I assure you we will do if we don\u0092t like what\u0092s going on.\u0094 She is now a foreign-policy advisor to Hillary Clinton.\r\n\u0093A leader taking his (or her) nation to war is as dysfunctional in the family of humankind as an abusive parent is in an individual family.\u0094 \u0096 Suzy Kane\r\n\u0093It would be some time before I fully realized that the United States sees little need for diplomacy. Power is enough. Only the weak rely on diplomacy The Roman Empire had no need for diplomacy. Nor does the United States.\u0094 \u0096 Boutros Boutros-Ghali , Secretary-General of the United Nations from January 1992 to December 1996\r\n\u0093Interventions are not against dictators but against those who try to distribute: not against Jim\u00e9nez in Venezuela but Ch\u00e1vez, not against Somoza in Nicaragua but the Sandinistas, not against Batista in Cuba but Castro, not against Pinochet in Chile but Allende, not against Guatemala dictators but Arbenz, not against the shah in Iran but Mossadegh, etc.\u0094 \u0096 Johan Galtung, Norwegian, principal founder of the discipline of peace and conflict studies\r\n\u0093No mention was made that Iraq\u0092s Christians had been safe and sound under President Saddam Hussein \u0096 even privileged \u0096 until President George Bush invaded and destroyed Iraq. We can expect the same fate for Syria\u0092s Christians if the protection of the Assad regime is torn away by the US-engineered uprising. We will then shed crocodile tears for Syria\u0092s Christians.\u0094 \u0096 Eric Margolis, 2014\r\n\u0093Jewish Power is the capacity to silence the debate on Jewish Power.\u0094 \u0096 Gilad Atzmon\r\n\u0093We need a trial to judge all those who bear significant responsibility for the past century - the most murderous and ecologically destructive in human history. We could call it the war, air and fiscal crimes tribunal and we could put politicians and CEOs and major media owners in the dock with earphones like Eichmann and make them listen to the evidence of how they killed millions of people and almost murdered the planet and made most of us far more miserable than we needed to be. Of course, we wouldn\u0092t have time to go after them one by one. We\u0092d have to lump Wall Street investment bankers in one trial, the Council on Foreign Relations in another, and any remaining Harvard Business School or Yale Law graduates in a third. We don\u0092t need this for retribution, only for edification. So there would be no capital punishment, but rather banishment to an overseas Nike factory with a vow of perpetual silence.\u0094 \u0096 Sam Smith\r\n\u0093I have come to think of the export of \u0091democracy\u0092 as the contemporary equivalent of what missionaries have always done in the interest of conquering and occupying the \u0091uncivilized\u0092 world on behalf of the powers that be. I have said that the \u0091church\u0092 invented the concept of conversion by any means, including torture and killing of course, as doing the victims a big favor, since it was in the interest of \u0091saving\u0092 their immortal souls. It is now called, \u0091democratization\u0092.\u0094 \u0096 Rita Corriel\r\n\u0093It is more or less impossible to commemorate the war dead without glorifying them, and it is impossible to glorify them without glorifying their wars.\u0094 \u0096 Paul Craig Roberts\r\nWilliam Blum is an author, historian, and U.S. foreign policy critic.

    "body_fr": "L\u2019influence des USA et de l\u2019Otan dans les rapports de l\u2019UE avec la Chine par Manlio Dinucci Intervenant dans un forum international, le g\u00e9ographe italien Manlio Dinucci synth\u00e9tise son analyse des armes dont les \u00c9tats-Unis se sont dot\u00e9s pour dominer l\u2019ensemble du monde. Cet article est d\u2019autant plus important que c\u2019est cette domination clairement assum\u00e9e, cette organisation unipolaire du monde, que la Syrie, la Russie et la Chine mettent aujourd\u2019hui en cause les armes \u00e0 la main.\r\nR\u00e9seau Voltaire | Rome (Italie) | 27 octobre 2016 Je vais tout de suite au n\u0153ud de la question. Je pense qu\u2019on ne peut pas parler de relations entre Union europ\u00e9enne et Chine ind\u00e9pendamment de l\u2019influence que les \u00c9tats-Unis exercent sur l\u2019Union europ\u00e9enne, directement et par l\u2019interm\u00e9diaire de l\u2019Otan.\r\nAujourd\u2019hui 22 des 28 pays de l\u2019UE (21 sur 27 apr\u00e8s la sortie du Royaume-Uni de l\u2019UE), avec plus de 90 % de la population de l\u2019Union, font partie de l\u2019Otan, reconnue par l\u2019UE comme \u00ab fondement de la d\u00e9fense collective \u00bb. Et l\u2019Otan est sous commandement US : le Commandant supr\u00eame alli\u00e9 en Europe est toujours nomm\u00e9 par le pr\u00e9sident des \u00c9tats-Unis d\u2019Am\u00e9rique et tous les autres commandements cl\u00e9 sont aux mains des USA. La politique \u00e9trang\u00e8re et militaire de l\u2019Union europ\u00e9enne est ainsi fondamentalement subordonn\u00e9e \u00e0 la strat\u00e9gie \u00e9tats-unienne, sur laquelle convergent les plus grandes puissances europ\u00e9ennes.\r\nCette strat\u00e9gie, clairement \u00e9nonc\u00e9e dans les documents officiels, est trac\u00e9e au moment historique o\u00f9 la situation mondiale change \u00e0 la suite de la d\u00e9sagr\u00e9gation de l\u2019URSS. En 1991 la Maison-Blanche d\u00e9clare dans la National Security Strategy of the United States : \u00ab Les \u00c9tats-Unis demeurent le seul \u00c9tat avec une force, une port\u00e9e et une influence en toute dimension \u2014politique, \u00e9conomique et militaire\u2014 r\u00e9ellement globales. Il n\u2019existe aucun substitut au leadership am\u00e9ricain \u00bb. En 1992, dans la Defense Planning Guidance , le Pentagone souligne : \u00ab Notre premier objectif est d\u2019emp\u00eacher qu\u2019une quelconque puissance domine une r\u00e9gion dont les ressources seraient suffisantes pour engendrer une puissance mondiale. Ces r\u00e9gions comprennent l\u2019Europe occidentale, l\u2019Asie orientale, le territoire de l\u2019ex-Union Sovi\u00e9tique et l\u2019Asie sud-occidentale \u00bb. En 2001, dans le rapport Quadrennial Defense Review \u2014publi\u00e9 une semaine avant la guerre USA/Otan en Afghanistan, aire de premi\u00e8re importance g\u00e9ostrat\u00e9gique \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de Russie et Chine\u2014, le Pentagone annonce : \u00ab La possibilit\u00e9 existe qu\u2019\u00e9merge dans la r\u00e9gion un rival militaire avec une formidable base de ressources. Nos forces arm\u00e9es doivent conserver la capacit\u00e9 d\u2019imposer la volont\u00e9 des \u00c9tats-Unis \u00e0 n\u2019importe quel adversaire, y compris \u00c9tats et entit\u00e9s non-\u00e9tatiques, de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 changer le r\u00e9gime d\u2019un \u00c9tat adverse ou occuper un territoire \u00e9tranger jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que les objectifs strat\u00e9giques \u00e9tats-uniens soient r\u00e9alis\u00e9s \u00bb.\r\nSur la base de cette strat\u00e9gie, l\u2019Otan sous commandement US a lanc\u00e9 son offensive sur le front oriental : apr\u00e8s avoir d\u00e9moli par la guerre la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Yougoslave, de 1999 \u00e0 aujourd\u2019hui elle a englob\u00e9 tous les \u00c9tats de l\u2019ex-Pacte de Varsovie, trois de l\u2019ex-Yougoslavie, trois de l\u2019ex-URSS, et sous peu elle en englobera d\u2019autres (\u00e0 commencer par la G\u00e9orgie et l\u2019Ukraine, cette derni\u00e8re \u00e9tant de fait d\u00e9j\u00e0 dans l\u2019Otan), en d\u00e9pla\u00e7ant bases et forces, y compris nucl\u00e9aires, toujours plus pr\u00e8s de la Russie. En m\u00eame temps, sur le front m\u00e9ridional \u00e9troitement reli\u00e9 \u00e0 celui oriental, l\u2019Otan sous commandement US a d\u00e9moli par la guerre l\u2019\u00c9tat libyen et a essay\u00e9 d\u2019en faire autant avec celui de la Syrie.\r\nLes USA et l\u2019Otan ont fait exploser la crise ukrainienne et, accusant la Russie de \u00ab d\u00e9stabiliser la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 europ\u00e9enne \u00bb, ils ont entra\u00een\u00e9 l\u2019Europe dans une nouvelle Guerre froide, voulue surtout par Washington (aux d\u00e9pens des \u00e9conomies europ\u00e9ennes \u00e0 qui les sanctions et contre-sanctions ont port\u00e9 pr\u00e9judice) pour casser les rapports \u00e9conomiques et politiques Russie-UE n\u00e9fastes aux int\u00e9r\u00eats \u00e9tats-uniens. C\u2019est dans la m\u00eame strat\u00e9gie qu\u2019entre le d\u00e9placement croissant de forces militaires \u00e9tats-uniennes dans la r\u00e9gion Asie/Pacifique dans une fonction anti-chinoise. L\u2019U.S. Navy a annonc\u00e9 qu\u2019en 2020 elle concentrera dans cette r\u00e9gion 60 % de ses forces navales et a\u00e9riennes.\r\nLa strat\u00e9gie \u00e9tats-unienne est focalis\u00e9e sur la mer de Chine M\u00e9ridionale, dont l\u2019amiral Harris, chef du Commandement US pour le Pacifique, souligne l\u2019importance : c\u2019est l\u00e0 que passe un commerce maritime d\u2019une valeur annuelle de plus de 5 000 milliards de dollars, dont 25 % de l\u2019export mondial de p\u00e9trole et 50 % de celui du gaz naturel. Les USA veulent contr\u00f4ler cette voie maritime au nom de celle que l\u2019amiral Harris d\u00e9finit comme une \u00ab libert\u00e9 de naviguer fondamentale pour notre syst\u00e8me de vie ici aux \u00c9tats-Unis \u00bb, en accusant la Chine d\u2019\u00ab actions agressives en mer Chinoise M\u00e9ridionale, analogues \u00e0 celles de la Russie en Crim\u00e9e \u00bb. Pour cela l\u2019U.S Navy \u00ab patrouille \u00bb la mer de Chine M\u00e9ridionale. Dans le sillage des \u00c9tats-Unis arrivent les plus grandes puissances europ\u00e9ennes : en juillet dernier la France a sollicit\u00e9 l\u2019Union europ\u00e9enne pour \u00ab coordonner la patrouille navale de la mer Chinoise M\u00e9ridionale afin d\u2019assurer une pr\u00e9sence r\u00e9guli\u00e8re et visible dans ces eaux ill\u00e9galement r\u00e9clam\u00e9es par la Chine \u00bb. Et tandis que les \u00c9tats-Unis installent en Cor\u00e9e du Sud des syst\u00e8mes \u00ab anti-missiles \u00bb mais en mesure de lancer aussi des missiles nucl\u00e9aires, analogues \u00e0 ceux install\u00e9s contre la Russie en Roumanie et bient\u00f4t en Pologne, en plus de ceux qui sont embarqu\u00e9s sur des navires de guerre en M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e, le secr\u00e9taire g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de l\u2019Otan Jens Stoltenberg re\u00e7oit le 6 octobre \u00e0 Bruxelles le ministre des Affaires \u00e9trang\u00e8res sud-cor\u00e9en, Yun Byung-se, pour \u00ab renforcer le partenariat de l\u2019Otan avec S\u00e9oul \u00bb.\r\nCes faits et d\u2019autres encore d\u00e9montrent qu\u2019en Europe et en Asie la m\u00eame strat\u00e9gie est \u00e0 l\u2019\u0153uvre. C\u2019est la tentative extr\u00eame des \u00c9tats-Unis et des autres puissances occidentales de maintenir la supr\u00e9matie \u00e9conomique, politique et militaire, dans un monde en forte transformation, dans lequel \u00e9mergent de nouveaux sujets \u00e9tatiques et sociaux. L\u2019Organisation de coop\u00e9ration de Shanghai, n\u00e9e de l\u2019accord strat\u00e9gique sino-russe, dispose de ressources et de capacit\u00e9s de travail capables d\u2019en faire la plus grande aire \u00e9conomique int\u00e9gr\u00e9e du monde. L\u2019Organisation de Shanghai et les Brics sont en mesure, avec leurs organismes financiers, de supplanter en grande partie la Banque mondiale et le Fonds mon\u00e9taire international qui, pendant plus de 70 ans, ont permis aux USA et aux plus grandes puissances occidentales de dominer l\u2019\u00e9conomie mondiale \u00e0 travers les pr\u00eats usuraires aux pays endett\u00e9s et d\u2019autres instruments financiers. Les nouveaux organismes peuvent en m\u00eame temps r\u00e9aliser la d\u00e9dollarisation des \u00e9changes commerciaux, en \u00f4tant aux \u00c9tats-Unis la capacit\u00e9 de d\u00e9charger leur dette sur d\u2019autres pays par l\u2019impression de papier monnaie utilis\u00e9 comme devise internationale dominante.\r\nPour maintenir leur supr\u00e9matie, toujours plus vacillante, les \u00c9tats-Unis utilisent non seulement la force des armes, mais d\u2019autres armes souvent plus efficaces que celles proprement dites.\r\n Premi\u00e8re arme : les dits \u00ab accords de libre-\u00e9change \u00bb, comme le \u00ab Partenariat transatlantique sur le commerce et les investissements \u00bb (TTIP) avec l\u2019UE et le \u00ab Partenariat Trans-Pacifique \u00bb (TPP) dont le but n\u2019est pas seulement \u00e9conomique mais g\u00e9opolitique et g\u00e9ostrat\u00e9gique. C\u2019est pour cela qu\u2019Hillary Clinton qualifie le partenariat USA-UE de \u00ab plus grand objectif strat\u00e9gique de notre alliance transatlantique \u00bb, en projetant une \u00ab Otan \u00e9conomique \u00bb qui int\u00e8gre celle politique et militaire. Le projet est clair : former un bloc politique, \u00e9conomique et militaire USA-UE, toujours sous commandement \u00e9tats-unien, qui s\u2019oppose \u00e0 l\u2019aire eurasiatique en ascension, bas\u00e9e sur la coop\u00e9ration entre la Chine et la Russie ; qui s\u2019oppose aux Brics, \u00e0 l\u2019Iran et \u00e0 tout autre pays qui se soustraie \u00e0 la domination de l\u2019Occident. Comme les n\u00e9gociations sur le TTIP ont du mal \u00e0 avancer \u00e0 cause de divergences d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat et d\u2019une vaste opposition en Europe, l\u2019obstacle est pour le moment contourn\u00e9 avec l\u2019 \u00ab Accord \u00e9conomique et commercial global \u00bb (CETA) entre le Canada et l\u2019UE : un TTIP camoufl\u00e9 \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que le Canada fait partie du NAFTA avec les USA. Le CETA sera probablement sign\u00e9 par l\u2019UE le 27 octobre prochain, pendant la visite du Premier ministre canadien Trudeau \u00e0 Bruxelles.\r\n Seconde arme : la p\u00e9n\u00e9tration dans les pays cible pour les d\u00e9sagr\u00e9ger de l\u2019int\u00e9rieur. En s\u2019appuyant sur les points faibles qu\u2019a tout pays en mesure diverse : la corruption, l\u2019avidit\u00e9 d\u2019argent, l\u2019arrivisme politique, le s\u00e9cessionnisme foment\u00e9 par des groupes de pouvoir locaux, le fanatisme religieux, la vuln\u00e9rabilit\u00e9 de vastes masses \u00e0 la d\u00e9magogie politique. En s\u2019appuyant aussi, dans certains cas, sur un m\u00e9contentement populaire justifi\u00e9 quant \u00e0 la conduite de leur gouvernement. Instruments de la p\u00e9n\u00e9tration : les soi-disant \u00ab organisations non gouvernementales \u00bb qui sont en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 la main longue du d\u00e9partement d\u2019\u00c9tat et de la CIA. Celles qui, dot\u00e9es d\u2019\u00e9normes moyens financiers, ont organis\u00e9 les \u00ab r\u00e9volutions color\u00e9es \u00bb dans l\u2019Est europ\u00e9en, et ont tent\u00e9 la m\u00eame op\u00e9ration avec la soi-disant \u00ab Umbrella Revolution \u00bb \u00e0 Hong Kong : qui visait \u00e0 fomenter des mouvements analogues dans d\u2019autres zones de la Chine habit\u00e9es par des minorit\u00e9s nationales. Les m\u00eames organisations qui op\u00e8rent en Am\u00e9rique Latine, avec l\u2019objectif premier de subvertir les institutions d\u00e9mocratiques du Br\u00e9sil, en minant ainsi les Brics de l\u2019int\u00e9rieur. Instruments de la m\u00eame strat\u00e9gie : les groupes terroristes, type ceux arm\u00e9s et infiltr\u00e9s en Libye et en Syrie pour semer le chaos, en contribuant \u00e0 la d\u00e9molition d\u2019\u00c9tats entiers attaqu\u00e9s en m\u00eame temps de l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur.\r\n Troisi\u00e8me arme : les \u00ab Psyops \u00bb (Op\u00e9rations psychologiques), lanc\u00e9es \u00e0 travers les cha\u00eenes m\u00e9diatiques mondiales, qui sont d\u00e9finies ainsi par le Pentagone : \u00ab Op\u00e9rations planifi\u00e9es pour influencer \u00e0 travers des informations d\u00e9termin\u00e9es les \u00e9motions et motivations et donc le comportement de l\u2019opinion publique, d\u2019organisations et de gouvernements \u00e9trangers, afin d\u2019induire ou renforcer des attitudes favorables aux objectifs pr\u00e9fix\u00e9s \u00bb. Avec ces op\u00e9rations, qui pr\u00e9parent l\u2019opinion publique \u00e0 l\u2019escalade guerri\u00e8re, on fait appara\u00eetre la Russie comme responsable des tensions en Europe et la Chine comme responsable des tensions en Asie, en les accusant en m\u00eame temps de \u00ab violation des droits humains \u00bb.\r\nManlio Dinucci, et son \u00e9pouse, Carla, devant la maison natale de Mao Ts\u00e9 Toung, en 1965. Une derni\u00e8re consid\u00e9ration : ayant travaill\u00e9 \u00e0 P\u00e9kin avec ma femme dans les ann\u00e9es Soixante, contribuant l\u2019un et l\u2019autre \u00e0 la publication de la premi\u00e8re revue chinoise en langue italienne, j\u2019ai v\u00e9cu une exp\u00e9rience formatrice fondamentale au moment o\u00f9 la Chine \u2014lib\u00e9r\u00e9e depuis \u00e0 peine quinze ans de la condition coloniale, semi-coloniale et semi-f\u00e9odale\u2014 \u00e9tait compl\u00e8tement isol\u00e9e et non reconnue par l\u2019Occident ni par les Nations Unies comme \u00c9tat souverain. De cette p\u00e9riode restent imprim\u00e9es en moi la capacit\u00e9 de r\u00e9sistance et la conscience de ce peuple, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque 600 millions de personnes, engag\u00e9 sous la conduite du Parti communiste \u00e0 construire une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 sur des bases \u00e9conomiques et culturelles compl\u00e8tement nouvelles.

Whenever cornered, the machine switches the narrative to Russian hacking of the DNC. Edward Snowden, who knows a thing or two about cyberwarfare, stresses there is no solid proof Russian intel hacked the Democratic/Clinton machine. And if they actually did it, the NSA would know. The fact the NSA is mum reveals this is no more than information war.\r\nPass the missile launchers, please Trump seems to have been more on the money when he insisted how Hillary will be outsmarted \u0096 as she already was in the past \u0096 when dealing with President Putin, who she has demonized as Hitler.\r\nI have shown how Hillary will be prevented from launching WWIII because her no-fly zone is already implemented in Syria by Russia. And the Pentagon \u0096 reflecting Dunford\u0092s comments - knows it, no matter how emphatically soon-to-be-unemployed Pentagon head Ash Carter threatens \u0093 consequences .\u0094\r\nThe Pentagon ranks Russia and China as the number one and two \u0093existential threats\u0094 to US national security, in that order. And the US government reserves for itself the privilege of a nuclear \u0093first-strike\u0094 \u0096 which Hillary supports (but not Trump); this is part of the 2002 Full Spectrum Dominance doctrine.\r\nThe relentless hysteria now crystallized as Cold War 2.0 has led scores of analysts to game the actual \u0096 terrifying - possibility of a US-Russia hot war. As much as the Cold War MAD (Mutually Assured Destruction) doctrine may now lie in the dust \u0096 exactly because Washington refuses to back down from \u0093first-strike\u0094 \u0096 only armchair Dr. Strangeloves get their kicks with the possibility of fighting a nuclear power. Dunford does not seem to be one of them.\r\nWhat Hillary Clinton will certainly do is to double down on proxy wars, Vietnam/Afghanistan-style. So expect a President Clinton to authorize full weaponization of those Beltway-loved \u0093moderate\u0094 Al-Qaeda-in-Syria rebels with plenty of shoulder-held missile launchers. This could easily get out of control \u0096 with lethal, yet not nuclear, consequences.\r\nThat\u0092s exactly the point made by Mikhail Rostovsky in Moscow daily Moskovsky Komsomolets; if Hillary ratchets up tensions, \u0093 things could get out of hand .\u0094\r\nAlso expect not so proxy ratcheting up of tension in the South China Sea; after all it was Hillary who claimed \u0091mothership\u0092 of the pivot to Asia; and it was Hillary who steered intra-South East Asian maritime disputes into the boiling cauldron of wider US-China competition.\r\nAnd if that was not hard boiled enough, US frustration will be at an all-time high after Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte\u0092s own pivot to China.\r\nSay hello to my new Sarmat A case can be made that official Moscow is carefully getting ready to work with a Clinton \u0096 as in Obama III \u0096 presidency, with Hillary, a devil they know well when she was Secretary of State, to be dealt with as a pragmatist, unwilling and unable to plunge US-Russia relations into total incandescence.\r\nA Clinton presidency for its part should know better than overestimate Russia\u0092s financial \u0093 weakness. \u0094\r\nThe national debt of Russia is only 17.7 percent of GDP; for the US it is a whopping 104.17 percent of GDP, or $19.2 trillion. Russia in 2015 had a trade surplus of $150 billion, while the US had a trade deficit of $531.5 billion. The current account surplus of Russia was 5.1 percent of GDP, or 65.8 billion, while the US ran a current account deficit of 484.1 billion, or 2.7 percent of GDP.\r\nBesides, Russia has all the natural resources it needs; unlike the US government, which believes it needs an empire of bases overseas and ten aircraft carrier task forces to secure the resources it lacks.\r\nMoreover, as much as the Pentagon may continue to be infested by neocon cells, sound generals are also able to identify key Russian signals \u0096 such as the unveiling of the RS-28 Sarmat nuclear missile, which NATO calls Satan 2. The Sarmat delivers monster warheads of 40 megatons; boasts a top speed of seven kilometers per second; and is able to outfox any anti-missile shield system anywhere.\r\nFirst images of new thermonuclear-armed intercontinental ballistic missile to replace 'Satan' unveilled in Russia https://t.co/mmX2EHALQu\r\n\u0097 RT (@RT_com) October 25, 2016\r\nHot war?

    "body_en": "written by Admin by Eric Zuesse, originally posted at strategic-culture.org Before I start this condemnation of lies from \u2018liberal\u2019 \u2018news\u2019 media, I should indicate that I am a former lifelong Democrat who left the Party over the corruption of the Obama Administration when the corruption became capped by their Democratic National Committee using many devices to steal the Presidential nomination away from Bernie Sanders, to hand it to Obama\u2019s chosen successor Hillary Clinton, whom Obama expected would complete his pro-Wall-Street legacy by passing into law some version of his trade treaties and by Hillary\u2019s conquering Russia, the latter of which goal was a U.S. government project that had actually started in secret on the night of 24 February 1990 when the then-President George Herbert Walker Bush initiated what has since become a ceaseless behind-the-scenes U.S. government program to expand NATO right up to Russia\u2019s borders and ultimately to conquer Russia itself. Though the Cold War ended authentically on Russia\u2019s side in 1991, it never really did end on the U.S. side (that was just a lie) \u2014 and Obama-Clinton were hoping soon to culminate the U.S. aristocracy\u2019s conquest of Russia. I remain a committed progressive journalist but am no longer committed to any political party, because now both of the major political parties are vile and no third party in a Presidential system of government stands a realistic chance of controlling either the Executive branch or the Legislative branch of government \u2014 its only function is to serve as \u201cspoiler\u201d for one or the other of the two. So: I am neither a Democrat nor a Republican, nor a supporter of some \u2018third\u2019 Party, but remain unchanged throughout, consistently a progressive, which means totally dedicated to truth and against lies (such as dominate all forms of conservatism). My criticisms of \u2018news\u2019media reflect that, no political-party orientation. \r\nOn November 9th, Salon\u2019s reporter Brendan Gauthier headlined Salon\u2019s top-of-homepage headline of the day, \u201cIn Donald Trump\u2019s cabinet from hell, corporatism and cronyism run rampant \u2014 and Sarah Palin may be there, too\u201d and reported what was at the time speculation that was sourced to an NBC news report, titled \u201cGingrich, Giuliani, Priebus Eyed for Top Jobs in Trump White House: Sources\u201d , which stated that: \r\nAmong the names being considered, according to conversations with three campaign advisers who requested anonymity to speak freely: Rudy Giuliani for attorney general, Newt Gingrich for secretary of state, retired Lt. Gen Michael Flynn for defense secretary or national security adviser, Trump finance chairman Steve Mnuchin for Treasury secretary, and Republican National Committee finance chair Lew Eisenberg for commerce secretary. \r\nTrump himself has not taken an active part in transition efforts, in part out of superstition: He fears too much planning before a victory might jinx the campaign. In 2012, he was shocked to read detailed stories on Mitt Romney\u2019s preparations for the White House long before election day\u2026 \r\nAlabama Senator Jeff Sessions, a loyal supporter, has taken a major role managing the transition effort, especially as the official transition chief, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, has drifted from the campaign\u2026 \r\nAsked for comment on the above names floated for cabinet posts, Trump campaign spokesman Hope Hicks replied by e-mail that \u201cnone of this is accurate.\u201d \r\nGauthier added nothing substantial to that NBC information (of which, maybe, \u201cnone of this is accurate\u201d) except to say such uninformative things as that Gingrich \u201cproved himself a rabid Trump surrogate\u201d and as that Giuliani \u201chas been a tireless, if controversial, surrogate for Trump on the trail and in the media.\u201d But in one instance Gauthier linked to a New York Post op-ed by Michael Flynn as being his source by which to allege regarding: \u201c Department of Defense Retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn: Trump\u2019s national security adviser was fired from his post as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency in 2014, which he attributed to his hawkishness.\u201d \r\nThat statement about Flynn is outright false. Here is all that Flynn\u2019s op-ed \u2014 Gauthier\u2019s cited source \u2014 actually said concerning his having been fired by Obama: \r\nTwo years ago, I was called into a meeting with the undersecretary of defense for intelligence and the director of national intelligence, and after some \u201cniceties,\u201d I was told by the USDI that I was being let go from DIA. It was definitely an uncomfortable moment (I suspect more for them than me). \r\nI asked the DNI (Gen. James Clapper) if my leadership of the agency was in question and he said it was not; had it been, he said, they would have relieved me on the spot. \r\nI knew then it had more to do with the stand I took on radical Islamism and the expansion of al Qaeda and its associated movements. I felt the intel system was way too politicized, especially in the Defense Department\u2026 \r\nI was pissed but knew that I had maintained my integrity and was determined in the few months I had left to continue the changes I was instituting and to keep beating the drum about the vicious enemy we were facing (still are)\u2026 \r\nWe\u2019re in a global war, facing an enemy alliance that \u2026 picks up radical Muslim countries and organizations such as Iran, al Qaeda, the Taliban and Islamic State. \r\nThat\u2019s a formidable coalition, and nobody should be shocked to discover that we are losing the war. \r\nThere was no indication whatsoever in the article, that Flynn had been fired on account of any \u201chawkishness.\u201d That allegation by Salon was simply fabricated. \r\nThe reality about Flynn\u2019s firing was the exact opposite: he was too \u2018dovish\u2019 to suit the neoconservative Barack Obama, who was now demanding that all of his top military generals support his goal of going to war against Russia. Flynn objected to that by saying that only one war at a time makes any sense, and that this war must be the defeat of jihadists, nothing else \u2014 certainly not a war against the other nuclear superpower. \r\nRather than Flynn\u2019s support of Trump being a reflection of their shared \u2018hawkishness\u2019, it reflects their strong belief that the view that Barack Obama holds and that Hillary Clinton holds even more strongly \u2014 that the war against jihadists must be subordinated to the war against Russia \u2014 is a totally upside-down view of the priorities, and that instead of the U.S. supporting jihadists who are warring against Russia and its allies, the U.S. ought to be supporting Russia and its allies who are warring against jihadists. \r\nIf Salon wants to support the Obama-Clinton view and oppose the Trump view on the basis of truthful assertions, then that\u2019s journalism and it is not mere political propaganda. \r\nBut if Salon wants to deceive its readers into holding the political viewpoint that they hold, then what else is there to call Salon but a propaganda-site?",

    "body_en": "Inside the Invisible Government\r\nBy John Pilger\r\n The American journalist, Edward Bernays, is often described as the man who invented modern propaganda. The nephew of Sigmund Freud, the pioneer of psycho-analysis, it was Bernays who coined the term \u0093public relations\u0094 as a euphemism for spin and its deceptions.\r\nIn 1929, he persuaded feminists to promote cigarettes for women by smoking in the New York Easter Parade \u0096 behaviour then considered outlandish. One feminist, Ruth Booth, declared, \u0093Women! Light another torch of freedom! Fight another sex taboo!\u0094 Bernays\u0092 influence extended far beyond advertising. His greatest success was his role in convincing the American public to join the slaughter of the First World War.\r\nThe secret, he said, was \u0093engineering the consent\u0094 of people in order to \u0093control and regiment [them] according to our will without their knowing about it\u0094.\r\nHe described this as \u0093the true ruling power in our society\u0094 and called it an \u0093invisible government\u0094.\r\nToday, the invisible government has never been more powerful and less understood. In my career as a journalist and film-maker, I have never known propaganda to insinuate our lives and as it does now and to go unchallenged.\r\nImagine two cities. Both are under siege by the forces of the government of that country. Both cities are occupied by fanatics, who commit terrible atrocities, such as beheading people. But there is a vital difference. In one siege, the government soldiers are described as liberators by Western reporters embedded with them, who enthusiastically report their battles and air strikes. There are front page pictures of these heroic soldiers giving a V-sign for victory. There is scant mention of civilian casualties.\r\nIn the second city \u0096 in another country nearby \u0096 almost exactly the same is happening. Government forces are laying siege to a city controlled by the same breed of fanatics. The difference is that these fanatics are supported, supplied and armed by \u0093us\u0094 \u0096 by the United States and Britain. They even have a media centre that is funded by Britain and America. Another difference is that the government soldiers laying siege to this city are the bad guys, condemned for assaulting and bombing the city \u0096 which is exactly what the good soldiers do in the first city.\r\nConfusing? Not really. Such is the basic double standard that is the essence of propaganda. I am referring, of course, to the current siege of the city of Mosul by the government forces of Iraq, who are backed by the United States and Britain and to the siege of Aleppo by the government forces of Syria, backed by Russia. One is good; the other is bad.\r\nWhat is seldom reported is that both cities would not be occupied by fanatics and ravaged by war if Britain and the United States had not invaded Iraq in 2003. That criminal enterprise was launched on lies strikingly similar to the propaganda that now distorts our understanding of the civil war in Syria. Without this drumbeat of propaganda dressed up as news, the monstrous ISIS and Al-Qaida and al-Nusra and the rest of the jihadist gang might not exist, and the people of Syria might not be fighting for their lives today.\r\nSome may remember in 2003 a succession of BBC reporters turning to the camera and telling us that Blair was \u0093vindicated\u0094 for what turned out to be the crime of the century. The US television networks produced the same validation for George W. Bush. Fox News brought on Henry Kissinger to effuse over Colin Powell\u0092s fabrications. The same year, soon after the invasion, I filmed an interview in Washington with Charles Lewis, the renowned American investigative journalist. I asked him, \u0093What would have happened if the freest media in the world had seriously challenged what turned out to be crude propaganda?\u0094\r\nHe replied that if journalists had done their job, \u0093there is a very, very good chance we would not have gone to war in Iraq\u0094.\r\nIt was a shocking statement, and one supported by other famous journalists to whom I put the same question \u0097 Dan Rather of CBS, David Rose of the Observer and journalists and producers in the BBC, who wished to remain anonymous. In other words, had journalists done their job, had they challenged and investigated the propaganda instead of amplifying it, hundreds of thousands of men, women and children would be alive today, and there would be no ISIS and no siege of Aleppo or Mosul. There would have been no atrocity on the London Underground on 7 th July 2005. There would have been no flight of millions of refugees; there would be no miserable camps.\r\nWhen the terrorist atrocity happened in Paris last November, President Francoi Hollande immediately sent planes to bomb Syria \u0096 and more terrorism followed, predictably, the product of Hollande\u0092s bombast about France being \u0093at war\u0094 and \u0093showing no mercy\u0094. That state violence and jihadist violence feed off each other is the truth that no national leader has the courage to speak.\r\n\u0093When the truth is replaced by silence,\u0094 said the Soviet dissident Yevtushenko, \u0093the silence is a lie.\u0094\r\nThe attack on Iraq, the attack on Libya, the attack on Syria happened because the leader in each of these countries was not a puppet of the West. The human rights record of a Saddam or a Gaddafi was irrelevant. They did not obey orders and surrender control of their country.\r\nThe same fate awaited Slobodan Milosevic once he had refused to sign an \u0093agreement\u0094 that demanded the occupation of Serbia and its conversion to a market economy. His people were bombed, and he was prosecuted in The Hague. Independence of this kind is intolerable. As WikLeaks has revealed, it was only when the Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad in 2009 rejected an oil pipeline, running through his country from Qatar to Europe, that he was attacked.\r\nFrom that moment, the CIA planned to destroy the government of Syria with jihadist fanatics \u0096 the same fanatics currently holding the people of Mosul and eastern Aleppo hostage. Why is this not news? The former British Foreign Office official Carne Ross, who was responsible for operating sanctions against Iraq, told me: \u0093We would feed journalists factoids of sanitised intelligence, or we would freeze them out. That is how it worked.\u0094\r\nThe West\u0092s medieval client, Saudi Arabia \u0096 to which the US and Britain sell billions of dollars\u0092 worth of arms \u0096 is at present destroying Yemen, a country so poor that in the best of times, half the children are malnourished. Look on YouTube and you will see the kind of massive bombs \u0096 \u0093our\u0094 bombs \u0096 that the Saudis use against dirt-poor villages, and against weddings, and funerals. The explosions look like small atomic bombs. The bomb aimers in Saudi Arabia work side-by-side with British officers. This fact is not on the evening news.\r\nPropaganda is most effective when our consent is engineered by those with a fine education \u0096 Oxford, Cambridge, Harvard, Columbia \u0097 and with careers on the BBC, the Guardia n, the New York Times , the Washington Post . These organisations are known as the liberal media. They present themselves as enlightened, progressive tribunes of the moral zeitgeist. They are anti-racist, pro-feminist and pro-LGBT.\r\nAnd they love war.\r\nWhile they speak up for feminism, they support rapacious wars that deny the rights of countless women, including the right to life. In 2011, Libya, then a modern state, was destroyed on the pretext that Muammar Gaddafi was about to commit genocide on his own people. That was the incessant news; and there was no evidence. It was a lie.\r\nIn fact, Britain, Europe and the United States wanted what they like to call \u0093regime change\u0094 in Libya, the biggest oil producer in Africa. Gaddafi\u0092s influence in the continent and, above all, his independence were intolerable. So he was murdered with a knife in his rear by fanatics, backed by America, Britain and France. Hillary Clinton cheered his gruesome death for the camera, declaring, \u0093We came, we saw, he died!\u0094\r\nThe destruction of Libya was a media triumph. As the war drums were beaten, Jonathan Freedland wrote in the Guardian : \u0093Though the risks are very real, the case for intervention remains strong.\u0094 Intervention \u0097 what a polite, benign, Guardian word, whose real meaning, for Libya, was death and destruction.\r\nAccording to its own records, Nato launched 9,700 \u0093strike sorties\u0094 against Libya, of which more than a third were aimed at civilian targets. They included missiles with uranium warheads. Look at the photographs of the rubble of Misurata and Sirte, and the mass graves identified by the Red Cross. The Unicef report on the children killed says, \u0093most [of them] under the age of ten\u0094. As a direct consequence, Sirte became the capital of ISIS.\r\nUkraine is another media triumph. Respectable liberal newspapers such as the New York Times , the Washington Post and the Guardian , and mainstream broadcasters such as the BBC, NBC, CBS, CNN have played a critical role in conditioning their viewers to accept a new and dangerous cold war. All have misrepresented events in Ukraine as a malign act by Russia when, in fact, the coup in Ukraine in 2014 was the work of the United States, aided by Germany and Nato.\r\n This inversion of reality is so pervasive that Washington\u0092s military intimidation of Russia is not news; it is suppressed behind a smear and scare campaign of the kind I grew up withduring the first cold war. Once again, the Ruskies are coming to get us, led by another Stalin, whom The Economist depicts as the devil.\r\nThe suppression of the truth about Ukraine is one of the most complete news blackouts I can remember. The fascists who engineered the coup in Kiev are the same breed that backed the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941. Of all the scares about the rise of fascist anti-Semitism in Europe, no leader ever mentions the fascists in Ukraine \u0096 except Vladimir Putin, but he does not count.\r\nMany in the Western media have worked hard to present the ethnic Russian-speaking population of Ukraine as outsiders in their own country, as agents of Moscow, almost never as Ukrainians seeking a federation within Ukraine and as Ukrainian citizens resisting a foreign-orchestrated coup against their elected government.\r\nThere is almost the joie d\u0092esprit of a class reunion of warmongers. The drum-beaters of the Washington Post inciting war with Russia are the very same editorial writers who published the lie that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction.\r\n To most of us, the American presidential campaign is a media freak show, in which Donald Trump is the arch villain. But Trump is loathed by those with power in the United States for reasons that have little to do with his obnoxious behaviour and opinions. To the invisible government in Washington, the unpredictable Trump is an obstacle to America\u0092s design for the 21 st century.\r\nThis is to maintain the dominance of the United States and to subjugate Russia, and, if possible, China.\r\nTo the militarists in Washington, the real problem with Trump is that, in his lucid moments, he seems not to want a war with Russia; he wants to talk with the Russian president, not fight him; he says he wants to talk with the president of China. In the first debate with Hillary Clinton, Trump promised not to be the first to introduce nuclear weapons into a conflict. He said, \u0093I would certainly not do first strike. Once the nuclear alternative happens, it\u0092s over.\u0094 That was not news.\r\nDid he really mean it? Who knows? He often contradicts himself. But what is clear is that Trump is considered a serious threat to the status quo maintained by the vast national security machine that runs the United States, regardless of who is in the White House. The CIA wants him beaten. The Pentagon wants him beaten. The media wants him beaten. Even his own party wants him beaten. He is a threat to the rulers of the world \u0096 unlike Clinton who has left no doubt she is prepared to go to war with nuclear-armed Russia and China.\r\nClinton has the form, as she often boasts. Indeed, her record is proven. As a senator, she backed the bloodbath in Iraq. When she ran against Obama in 2008, she threatened to \u0093totally obliterate\u0094 Iran. As Secretary of State, she colluded in the destruction of governments in Libya and Honduras and set in train the baiting of China. She has now pledged to support a No Fly Zone in Syria \u0097 a direct provocation for war with Russia. Clinton may well become the most dangerous president of the United States in my lifetime \u0096a distinction for which the competition is fierce.\r\nWithout a shred of evidence, she has accused Russia of supporting Trump and hacking her emails. Released by WikiLeaks, these emails tell us that what Clinton says in private, in speeches to the rich and powerful, is the opposite of what she says in public. That is why silencing and threatening Julian Assange is so important. As the editor of WikiLeaks, Assange knows the truth. And let me assure those who are concerned, he is well, and WikiLeaks is operating on all cylinders.\r\nToday, the greatest build-up of American-led forces since World War Two is under way \u0096 in the Caucasus and eastern Europe, on the border with Russia, and in Asia and the Pacific, where China is the target. Keep that in mind when the presidential election circus reaches its finale on November 8 th, If the winner is Clinton, a Greek chorus of witless commentators will celebrate her coronation as a great step forward for women. None will mention Clinton\u0092s victims: the women of Syria, the women of Iraq, the women of Libya. None will mention the civil defence drills being conducted in Russia. None will recall Edward Bernays\u0092 \u0093torches of freedom\u0094.\r\nGeorge Bush\u0092s press spokesman once called the media \u0093complicit enablers\u0094.\r\nComing from a senior official in an administration whose lies, enabled by the media, caused such suffering, that description is a warning from history.\r\nIn 1946, the Nuremberg Tribunal prosecutor said of the German media: \u0093Before every major aggression, they initiated a press campaign calculated to weaken their victims and to prepare the German people psychologically for the attack. In the propaganda system, it was the daily press and the radio that were the most important weapons.\u0094\r\n This text is adapted from an address to the Sheffield Festival of Words, Sheffield, England , On 27 October 2016. http://johnpilger.com",

By trying to suspend Russia from the council, the flagrant intent is to discredit and further demonize. The 47-member UNHRC, based in Geneva, is the United Nations\u0092 premier inter-governmental forum on human rights. Members are selected on a rotational basis. On Friday, 14 seats on the council are up for renewal.\r\nThis week 80 mainly Western non-governmental organizations associated with human rights reportedly urged the UNHRC to drop Russia\u0092s membership, citing allegations of war crimes committed during military operations to capture the Syrian city of Aleppo.\r\nOver 80 NGOs call for Russia to be dropped from UN rights council over Syria https://t.co/uKTfWXWOLn\r\n\u0097 RT (@RT_com) 24 \u043e\u043a\u0442\u044f\u0431\u0440\u044f 2016 \u0433. Among the anti-Russia lobby were US-based and George Soros-funded Human Rights Watch. Notably, billionaire financier Soros is an open advocate for regime change in Russia.\r\nThe campaign to undermine Russia at the UNHRC was preceded last week when Britain \u0096 also a member of the council \u0096 convened a summit in Geneva. The council issued a resolution which pointedly condemned bombing of civilians in Syria, and implicitly laid the blame on Russia and allied Syrian state forces.\r\nRussia\u0092s permanent representative in Geneva Alexey Borodavkin rebuked the UNHRC for a one-sided, politicized statement, which he said sought to solely impugn Russia and Syria.

They are also sending their air forces on illegal bombing raids across the country \u0096 in the name of \u0093fighting terrorism\u0094 \u0096 which has resulted in hundreds of civilian casualties and the destruction of social infrastructure, such as roads, bridges, public buildings and residential homes.\r\nIn recent months, warplanes dispatched by the US, France and Belgium (the latter two current members of the UNHRC) have carried out air strikes on Syria causing dozens of civilian casualties.\r\nSo, of course, Western-orchestrated claims against Russia over alleged human rights violations in Syria are patently hypocritical and belie their own criminality.\r\nThe contrived effort to delist Russia from the UNHRC has the same hallmark as other Western media campaigns to discredit Moscow, such as the banning of Russian athletes from the Rio Olympics on dubious drug-abuse charges, or the pseudo-probe into the downing of the Malaysian airliner in 2014 over Ukraine, or overblown claims that Russian aggression is threatening the security of Europe. We can also include baseless accusations made by shadowy US intelligence agencies that Russia is hacking into computer systems to somehow disrupt the American presidential elections next month.\r\nSaudi Arabia poised to be reelected to UN Human Rights Council https://t.co/sqWeSwjg48 #UNHR #SaudiArabia #humanrights\r\n\u0097 RT (@RT_com) 27 \u043e\u043a\u0442\u044f\u0431\u0440\u044f 2016 \u0433. The UNHRC debacle is one strand in a bundle of psychological operations aimed at isolating, demonizing and delegitimizing Russia.\r\nPerhaps the knock out absurdity in the latest rush by the Western lynch mob is the relation of Britain and Saudi Arabia, both of which are current members of the UNHRC seeking renewal of their seats.\r\nThat Saudi Arabia \u0096 widely seen as the most repressive regime on Earth \u0096 is even a member of the prestigious Geneva council is due to Britain engaging in underhand vote rigging to help its oil-rich ally gain a seat, according to documents released last year by WikiLeaks.\r\nA Saudi-led military coalition continues to slaughter thousands of Yemeni civilians by bombing schools, hospitals, mosques, marketplaces, funeral halls, factories and residential homes. Human rights groups like HRW and UN agencies are well aware of this Saudi campaign of mass murder in Yemen. It is also well documented that US, British, French and German weaponry worth billions of dollars is assisting the Saudi regime in its war crimes. That makes these Western states fully complicit.\r\nMoscow summons Belgian ambassador, presents data on F-16s bombing of Syrian civilians https://t.co/WzwvworaZd pic.twitter.com/cHlKvzaeUD\r\n\u0097 RT (@RT_com) 21 \u043e\u043a\u0442\u044f\u0431\u0440\u044f 2016 \u0433. Germany, for example, which is also a current member of the UNHRC, has seen its arms exports to Saudi Arabia jump by 250 percent over the past two years, according to a report last week.\r\nBritain, the ringleader of the media campaign to denigrate Russia in Geneva, has sold over $4 billion worth of armaments to Saudi Arabia since the oil kingdom launched its aggression on its southern neighbor in March 2015. Even while Saudi Arabia is committing the most egregious crimes against humanity, the British government continues to send Royal Air Force pilots to help train Saudi counterparts, brazenly denying that there is any breach of international law.\r\nThere is little or no protest from the 80 NGO rights groups about these applicant states to the next cohort of the UNHRC.\r\nThe hypocrisy and double standards of serial human rights violators make their condemnations against Russia null and void.\r\nImportantly too, is to not merely rebut the accusers as hypocrites, but to also elucidate the anti-Russia claims as fabrications.\r\nThe information that Western governments, rights groups and media base their claims of Russia bombing civilians is garnered from entirely dubious and partisan sources. Endless reports on Syria and the battle for the northern city of Aleppo broadcast by multibillion dollar Western news organizations are based, incongruously, either on claims issued by the British-located so-called Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, or by \u0093activist\u0094 groups within terrorist-held east Aleppo, which are funded by Western governments, such as the purported \u0093rescue workers\u0094 of the White Helmets and the Aleppo Media Center.\r\nBREAKING: UN Human Rights Council votes to open probe into #Aleppo \u0091war crimes\u0092 https://t.co/xrdojTxO3v pic.twitter.com/2gKhTiMovH\r\n\u0097 RT (@RT_com) 21 \u043e\u043a\u0442\u044f\u0431\u0440\u044f 2016 \u0433. In other words, Western governments, media, rights groups, and, sadly, UN agencies are promulgating an anti-Russia narrative that is recycled terrorist propaganda.Good proof of this is seen on the TV station called \u0093Free Syria\u0094 broadcast across the Middle East and North Africa on Saudi-owned satellite platform ArabSat.\r\nFree Syria is a crude propaganda channel funded by the Saudi monarchy. It features jingoistic images of Saudi King Salman, along with Saudi troops, warplanes and tanks.\r\nFree Syria also features links to the militant group Ahrar al-Sham, which is implicated in countless terrorist crimes along with Nusra and ISIS. Bearded militants are routinely shown firing mortars while shouting Islamist slogans.\r\nAnother regular contributor to the images and \u0093reports\u0094 on this Saudi-funded, terrorist-supporting channel are the White Helmets and the Aleppo Media Center. Thus, on this publicly available \u0093Free Syria\u0094 channel what we see in stark reality is how state sponsor, terrorist networks and propaganda machine come together in a self-incriminating amalgam.\r\nWhat is even more damning is that the same \u0093 information\u0094 is disseminated \u0096 albeit in a more polished form \u0096 through Western news outlets, such as CNN, BBC, France 24 and a gamut of supposedly respectable newspapers, like the New York Times and British Guardian.\r\nIt\u0092s an astounding feat how reality can be so inverted. Russia\u0092s military is legally justified in assisting the allied sovereign government of Syria to defeat a covert war to topple the state. That war is a criminal enterprise fueled by Washington, London and Paris through the deployment of myriad terrorist proxies.\r\nAnd to add insult to injury, these terrorist-sponsoring rogue states then turn around and accuse Russia at a UN Human Rights Council based on propaganda sourced from their terrorist proxies.\r\nThe utter insanity of it all. But maybe the Western lynch mob will eventually get hoisted on their own coiling ropes of deception.",

    "title_en": "Russian Spies and America\u0092s Reality TV Election       : Information",
    "body_en": "Russian Spies and America\u0092s Reality TV Election By Finian Cunningham\r\nNovember 14, \" Sputnik \" - After months of mudslinging and vitriol, US President-elect Donald Trump was greeted this week by a chummy President Obama with a cozy fireside seat at the White House.\r\nSome media outlets sniped at Trump\u0092s surprise election calling him the \u0093first reality TV star to become president\u0094. In truth, the whole US political system seems to be a reality TV show.\r\nIn the weeks up to polling day on November 8, Democrat candidate Hillary Clinton and large sections of the US media were denouncing Trump as a \u0093Russian stooge\u0094. Trump\u0092s alleged friendliness towards Russian President Vladimir Putin was said to be proof that the Republican candidate was a \u0093Kremlin agent\u0094. The Kremlin rejected the accusations as fatuous, pointing out that there was not a scintilla of evidence.\r\nThe claims, however, were not merely electioneering rhetoric to smear Trump. The Obama administration officially weighed in to accuse Russia of state-sponsored hacking of computer systems and \u0093interfering in the US election\u0094 to get Trump elected. The White House based its provocative allegations on an assessment made by the Director of National Intelligence and Department of Homeland Security. In other words, US accusations of Russian subversion could not have been leveled in a more serious way.\r\nThat means, if you follow this logic, that Trump is now heading to occupy the White House thanks to Russian espionage and propaganda influencing the vote in his favor. So, what then was outgoing President Obama doing holding photo ops with \u0093Comrade Trump\u0094 in the Oval Office, smiling and exchanging pleasantries? At one point, the incumbent Commander-in-Chief said he was \u0093rooting for Trump\u0092s presidency to succeed because if it does then America will succeed\u0094. Hold on a moment. Only days before this avuncular tete-a-tete marking the \u0093peaceful transition of power\u0094, Obama\u0092s administration and the mainstream media were labelling Trump as a Russian fifth columnist. Obama had also mocked Trump as being \u0093uniquely unqualified\u0094 to be president with access to the nuclear keys.\r\nIt is notable how US media claims of Russian spying and interference suddenly ceased the day after Trump was elected. Granted, there have since been lame attempts to make something sinister out of the news that Russian diplomats were admittedly in touch with Trump and Clinton campaign aides before the election. Apart from that damp-squib story that the New York Times and Washington Post tried to enliven, for the most part the \u0093Russian hacker\u0094 hue and cry before the election has strangely disappeared from the public arena. In the light of Trump\u0092s cordial reception at the White House and the general acceptance by the Washington establishment including President Obama, defeated candidate Hillary Clinton and the mainstream media, that is stunning evidence that the whole anti-Russia bashing prior to the election was completely concocted and disingenuous. Think about it. How could Trump be painted one day as a beneficiary of Russian espionage, and then the next day literally, he is being feted as the \u009345th president of the USA\u0094 \u0096 whom, as Obama says, \u0093we are rooting for\u0094? This demonstrates how degraded US statecraft has become. The government, its intelligence services and the country\u0092s supposed quality news media are all prepared to fabricate and propagate lies against a foreign state \u0096 Russia. Obviously, because how could serious concerns one day be so easily jettisoned the next?\r\nEvidently, the demonization of Russia as a hostile, interfering foreign power trying to upend US internal politics is a gross falsehood. Otherwise why would Trump be officially accepted? And why have all the grave media claims just vanished? But a much more serious aspect to this official US propaganda is that it illustrates how Russia is being set up more generally as an \u0093enemy state\u0094. Recall that US intelligence agencies were reportedly preparing to launch cyber attacks on Russian infrastructure all on the back of claims that Russia was hacking into the American presidential elections. If somehow US cyber attacks were carried out to cripple Russian industries and public utilities that would have constituted an act of war. Russia would have been obliged to respond, and the whole dangerous dynamic could have escalated to an all-out war.\r\nIf US government and its intelligence agencies, as well as supposedly independent news media, are seen to be so disingenuous, then that destroys their credibility on other matters. Can you believe anything they say about Russia with regard to allegedly threatening European security or committing war crimes in Syria? For his part, Donald Trump also plays a starring role in the US democracy charade. During their fireside meeting in the White House, the billionaire property tycoon called Obama a \u0093very good man\u0094 and said that he would seek his counsel in the future. This is the same \u0093very good man\u0094 whom Trump had earlier accused of being the \u0093creator of the ISIS [Daesh] terror group\u0094. Along with Clinton, Trump had rallied his supporters to view Obama as a treasonous criminal for waging illegal wars in the Middle East.\r\nWell, that\u0092s a spectacular U-turn by the fiery, big-mouth anti-politician Trump. If he can so quickly accommodate himself to such apparently hated political enemies and effectively drop all charges then one wonders what else Trump will renege on? Will he really \u0093drain the swamp\u0094 of Washington\u0092s oligarchic establishment? Will he deliver on \u0093making America great again\u0094 by investing in the \u0093forgotten people\u0094 who elected him? Will he really de-escalate American overseas militarism and NATO aggression towards Russia? It was surely a good thing that Hillary Clinton was not elected as president. Her warmongering record as former Secretary of State speaks for itself, as does her overt Russophobia.\r\nBut we should not be under illusions that a Trump presidency represents a new contrite and cooperative America. An American president is only ever a figurehead for a system and structure of power. That system relies on militarism and war to project US hegemony in the world. Without hegemonic relationships and imperialist conduct, US capitalism as we know it would collapse. And Trump is a raw-toothed capitalist. His early selections show a preference for further neoliberal deregulation of capital, as well as surrounding himself with his family and business cronies. Trump may be a pragmatic businessman inclined to form relations free from ideology. Potentially, that is a good thing for improving US relations with Russia and other foreign powers. Nevertheless, it would be naive to expect one individual to radically change a political system. It is not hard to imagine that when Trump enters the White House formally in 1o weeks that the military-intelligence-corporate apparatus of American capitalism will impress on him how the system works. And he will oblige. Trump\u0092s polite deference to Obama this week, and vice versa, shows in an unintended way what Obama meant when he said \u0093we are all on one team\u0094. That \u0093team\u0094 is the American oligarchy. It is not the American nation. Disenfranchised working-class Americans may simply have gotten Trump into the \u0093team\u0094 \u0096 against their genuine aspirations for radical democratic change. The rapid disappearance of Russian hacker allegations as well as Trump\u0092s anti-establishment bombast suggest that American \u0093democracy\u0094 is all just one giant reality TV show.",

    "title_en": "Anti-Trump Protesters Are Tools of the Oligarchy     : Information",
    "body_en": "Anti-Trump Protesters Are Tools of the Oligarchy \u0093Reform always provokes rage on the part of those who profit by the old order.\u0094 Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., The Crisis of the Old Order\r\nBy Paul Craig Roberts\r\n Who are the anti-Trump protesters besmirching the name of progressives by pretending to be progressives and by refusing to accept the outcome of the presidential election? They look like, and are acting worse than, the \u0093white trash\u0094 that they are denouncing.\r\nI think I know who they are. They are thugs for hire and are paid by the Oligarchy to delegitimize Trump\u0092s presidency in the way that Washington and the German Marshall Fund paid students in Kiev to protest the democratically elected Ukrainian government in order to prepare the way for a coup.\r\nThe organization, change.org, which claims to be a progressive group, but might be a front, along with other progressive groups, for the Oligarchy, is destroying the reputation of all progressives by circulating a petition that directs the electors of the Electoral Collage to annul the election by casting their votes for Hillary. Remember how upset progressives were when Trump said he might not accept the election result if there was evidence that the vote was rigged? Now progressives are doing what they damned Trump for saying he might do under certain conditions.\r\nThe Western presstitutes used the protests in Kiev to delegitimize a democratically elected government and to set it up for a coup. The protest pay was good enough that non-Ukrainians came from nearby countries to participate in the protest in order to collect the money. At the time I posted the amounts paid daily to protesters. Reports came in to me from Eastern and Western Europe from people who were not Ukrainian but were paid to protest as if they were Ukrainians.\r\nThe same thing is going on with the Trump protests. CNN reports that \u0093for many Americans across the country, Donald Trump\u0092s victory is an outcome they simply refuse to accept. Tens of thousands filled the streets in at least 25 US cities overnight.\u0094 This is the exact reporting that the Oligarchy desired from its presstitutes and got.\r\nI hope no one thinks that simultaneous protests in 25 cities were a spontaneous event. How did 25 independent protests manage to come up with the same slogans and the same signs on the same night following the election?\r\nWhat is the point of the protests, and what interest is served by them? As the Romans always asked, \u0093who benefits?\u0094\r\nThere is only one answer: The Oligarchy and only the Oligarchy benefits.\r\nTrump is a threat to the Oligarchy, because he intends to stop the giveaway of American jobs to foreigners. The jobs giveaway, sanctified by the neoliberal junk economists as \u0093free trade,\u0094 is one of the main reasons for the 21st century worsening of the US income distribution. Money that was formerly paid in middle class wages and salaries to American manufacturing employees and college graduates has been re-routed to the pockets of the One Percent.\r\nWhen US corporations move their production of goods and services sold to Americans offshore to Asian countries, such as China and India, their wage bill falls. The money formerly paid in middle class incomes goes instead into executive bonuses and dividends and capital gains to shareholders. The ladders of upward mobility that had made America the land of opportunity were dismantled for the sole purpose of making a handful of people multi-billionaires.\r\nTrump is a threat to the Oligarchy, because he intends peaceful relations with Russia. In order to replace the profitable Soviet Threat, the Oligarchy and their neoconservative agents worked overtime to recreate the \u0093Russian Threat\u0094 by demonizing Russia.\r\nAccustomed to many decades of excess profits from the profitable Cold War, the military/security complex was angry when President Reagan brought the Cold War to an end. Before these leaches on American taxpayers could get the Cold War going again, the Soviet Union collapsed as a result of a right-wing coup against Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev.\r\nThe military/security complex and their zionist neoconservative agents cooked up \u0093the war on terror\u0094 to keep the money flowing to the One Percent. But as hard as the presstitute media worked to create fear of \u0093the Muslim threat,\u0094 even insouciant Americans knew that the Muslims did not have thousands of ICBMs carrying powerful thermo-nuclear weapons capable of destroying the entirety of the United States in a few minutes. Neither did the Muslims have the Red Army capable of overrunning all of Europe in a couple of days. Indeed, the Muslims haven\u0092t needed an army. Refugees from Washington\u0092s wars enabled by Europeans are overrunning Europe.\r\nThe excuse for the annual trillion dollar ($1,000 billion ) military/security budget was missing. So the Oligarchy created \u0093the New Hitler\u0094 in Russia. Hillary was the Oligarchy\u0092s principle agent for heating up the new Cold War.\r\nHillary is the tool, enriched by the Oligarchy, whose job as President was to protect and to increase the trillion dollar budget of the military/security complex. With Hillary in the White House, the looting of the American taxpayers in behalf of the wealth of the One Percent could go forward unimpeded. But if Trump resolves \u0093the Russian threat,\u0094 the Oligarchy takes an income hit.\r\nHillary\u0092s job as President was also to privatize Social Security in order that her Wall Street benefactors can rip off Americans the way that Americans have been ripped off by the insurance companies under Obamacare.\r\nThose Americans who do not pay attention think, mistakenly, that the FBI cleared Hillary of violating National Security protocols with her email practices. The FBI said that Hillary did violate National Security, but that it was a result of carelessness or ignorance. She got off from indictment, because the FBI concluded that she did not intentionally violate National Security protocols. The investigation of the Clinton Foundation continues.\r\nIn other words, in order to protect Hillary the FBI fell back on the ancient common law rule that \u0093there can be no crime without intent.\u0094 (See PCR and Lawrence Stratton, The Tyranny of Good Intentions .)\r\nOne would think that protesters, if they were legitimate, would be celebrating Trump\u0092s victory. He, unlike Hillary, promises to reduce tensions with powerful Russia, and we hope also with China. Unlike Hillary, Trump says he is concerned with the absence of careers for those very people protesting in the streets of 25 cities against him.\r\nIn other words, the protests against the American people for electing Trump as their president are pointless. The protests are happening for one reason only. The Oligarchy intends to delegitimize the Trump Presidency. Once President Trump is delegitimized, it will be easier for the Oligarchy to assassinate him. Unless the Oligarchy can appoint and control Trump\u0092s government, Trump is a prime candidate for assassination.\r\nThe protests against Trump are suspicious for another reason. Unlike Hillary, Obama, and George W. Bush, Donald Trump has not slaughtered and dislocated millions of peoples in seven countries, sending millions of refugees from the Oligarchy\u0092s wars to overrun Europe.\r\nTrump earned his fortune, and if by hook or crook, not by selling US government influence to foreign agents as Bill and Hillary did.\r\nSo what are the protesters protesting?\r\nThere is no answer except that they are hired to protest. Just as the Maidan protesters in Kiev were hired to protest by US and German financed NGOs.\r\nThe protests in Kiev were equally pointless, because presidential elections were only months away. If Ukrainians really believed that their president was conspiring with Russia to keep Ukraine from becoming a Western puppet state and wished to become a puppet state regardless of the costs, the opportunity to vote the government out was at hand. The only reason for the protests was to orchestrate a coup. The US did succeed in putting their agent in control of the new Ukrainian government as Victoria Nuland and the US ambassador in Kiev confirmed in their telephone conversation that is available on the Internet.\r\nThe Maidan protests were pointless except for making a coup possible. The protests were without any doubt arranged by Washington through Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland, a neoconservative brought into the State Department by Hillary Clinton for the purpose of creating conflict with Russia.\r\nTrump is being protested in order to make him vulnerable in the event he proves to be the threat to the Oligarchy that he is thought to be.\r\nTrump won the presidency, but the Oligarchy is still in power, which makes any real reforms difficult to achieve. Symbolic reforms can be the product of the contest between President Trump and the oligarchs.\r\nKarl Marx learned from historical experience, and Lenin, Stalin, and Pol Pot learned from Karl Marx, that change cannot occur if the displaced ruling class is left intact after a revolution against them. We have proof of this throughout South America. Every revolution by the indigenous people has left unmolested the Spanish ruling class, and every revolution has been overthrown by collusion between the ruling class and Washington.\r\nWashington has conspired with traditional elites to remove the elected presidents of Honduras on a number of occasions. Recently, Washington helped elites evict the female presidents of Argentina and Brazil. The presidents of Venezuela, Ecuador, and Bolivia are in the crosshairs and are unlikely to survive. Washington is determined to get its hands on Julian Assange. To achieve this Washington intends to overthrow the Ecuadoran government that, in defiance of Washington, gave Julian Assange political asylum.\r\nHugo Chavez had the power to exile or to exterminate the Spanish ruling class in Venezuela when the ruling class participated in a CIA coup against Chavez. But before the CIA could kill Chavez, the people and the military forced his release. Instead of punishing the criminals who would have murdered him, Chavez let them go.\r\nAccording to Marx, Lenin, and Stalin, this is the classic mistake of the revolutionary. To rely on good will from the overthrown ruling class is the certain road to the defeat of the revolution.\r\nLatin American has proved itself unable to learn this lesson: Revolutions cannot be conciliatory.\r\nTrump is a dealmaker. The Oligarchy can permit him the sheen of success in exchange for no real change.\r\nTrump is not perfect. He might fail on his own. But we should back him on the two most important elements in his program: to reduce tensions between the major nuclear powers, and to halt Washington\u0092s policy of permitting globalism to destroy Americans\u0092 economic prospects.\r\nIf tensions between nuclear powers worsen, we won\u0092t be here to worry about other problems. The combination of the economy hollowed out by globalism and immigration is an economic nightmare. That Trump understands this is reason to support him.\r\nNote: Some believe that Trump is a ruse conducted by the Oligarchy. However, as Hillary is the bought-and-paid-for representative of the Oligarchy, such an elaborate ruse is unnecessary. It is preferable for the Oligarchy to win on its own platform than to install a president on the opposite platform and then change him around. Another sellout increases the anger of the people. If Hillary had won, the Oligarchy would have had the voters\u0092 mandate for their platform.\r\nDr. Paul Craig Roberts was Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Economic Policy and associate editor of the Wall Street Journal. He was columnist for Business Week, Scripps Howard News Service, and Creators Syndicate. He has had many university appointments. His internet columns have attracted a worldwide following. Roberts' latest books are The Failure of Laissez Faire Capitalism and Economic Dissolution of the West , How America Was Lost , and The Neoconservative Threat to World Order .",
