    "body_en": "FBI officials say their investigation into links between US Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and Russia has been unable to uncover any so far, according to the New York Times.\r\nThe bureau has been trying to find evidence showing that the Russian government is trying to influence the US presidential campaign since the beginning of summer. FBI agents have put advisers close to GOP candidate Donald Trump under close scrutiny, searching for financial connections that some have alleged exist between the nominee and Russian financial figures. They even followed up on a lead hinting that there had been a secret email correspondence between Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Organization and Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Alfa-bank. All the while, the bureau has been searching for the hackers that breached the computers of the Democratic camp and leaked emails that became the source of many scandals damaging to Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s campaign.\r\nNonetheless, the FBI still cannot say that any of its investigations have uncovered direct links between Trump and Russian authorities, the New York Times reported on Monday, citing recent interviews and its own bureau sources.\r\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153No evidence has emerged that would link [Trump] or anyone else in his business or political circle directly to Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election operations,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d writes the NYT.\r\nOfficials also anonymously told the NYT that whoever the hackers were, the attacks were aimed at disrupting the presidential race on the whole, and not boosting Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chances of getting into the Oval Office, as the Western media and Democrats have been claiming.\r\nIn explaining why Russia would want to interfere in the campaign, one senior official was cited as saying, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t about the election\u00e2\u20ac\u015a It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s about a threat to democracy.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\r\nThe FBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inquiries will continue, however. In interviews over the past several weeks, intelligence officials have signaled that they have opened a larger probe to look into suspicions over connections between Trump aides and Moscow.\r\nIn the most recent lead, an anonymous computer scientist going by the name Tea Leaves found some 2,700 \u00e2\u20ac\u0153look-up\u00e2\u20ac\u009d messages that tied a server being used by one of Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s companies to those of Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Alfa Bank.\r\nStill, the FBI found that there was no two-way communication, and these messages could have been marketing emails or spam. Both the Trump campaign and Alfa Bank issued statements denying that they had been in communication.\r\n\r\nThe FBI is also probing Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, whose foreign business and political dealings have come under scrutiny since reports surfaced claiming he was involved with a pro-Russian political party in Ukraine, NBC reported, citing intelligence sources.\r\n\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcRussia hacking\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 vs Clinton emails \r\nA separate report from CNBC citing a former FBI official claims that the bureau\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s director, James Comey, was privately reluctant about naming Russia as the entity responsible for meddling in the US election campaign, reportedly saying it was too close to the November 8 Election Day.\r\nIn the beginning of October, Comey allegedly concluded that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a foreign power was trying to undermine the election,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d but arguing against putting it out before the election itself.\r\nHe also allegedly made sure that the Federal Bureau of Investigation was not mentioned in the document compiled by the US government on October 7, which officially accused Russia of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153authorizing\u00e2\u20ac\u009d the hacking of emails accounts of US officials and organizations, out of concern that the FBI would be seen as interfering with the election if it was included.\r\nHowever, last Friday, with the election mere days away, Comey announced that the bureau was reopening its investigation into Hillary Clinton because several hundred thousand new emails that may be related to the private server used by the Democratic nominee had allegedly been discovered.\r\nThe announcement, which left many in the government puzzled, has already resulted in official complaints and attacks from the entire US political spectrum. On Monday, some 100 former federal prosecutors and senior Department of Justice officials, including Attorney General Eric Holder, signed a letter expressing concern over Comey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to reopen the case \u00e2\u20ac\u0153on the eve of a major election,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the mere disclosure of information may impact the election\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s outcome\u00e2\u20ac\u009d at this stage.\r\nClinton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s supporters have accused Comey of deliberately hiding \u00e2\u20ac\u0153explosive\u00e2\u20ac\u009d information about Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s alleged ties to Russia, demanding that he discuss them publicly, just as he did with the new batch of Clinton-related emails.\r\nHillary Clinton and her supporters have repeatedly criticized Trump for praising Russian President Vladimir Putin, while Trump has retorted that he has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153nothing to do\u00e2\u20ac\u009d with Russia and doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know its leader personally.\r\nPutin on accusations of meddling: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcrubbish\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 \r\nRussia, in turn, has denied having any links to the Trump camp on numerous occasions, while refuting accusations that it had been behind the hacking attacks on the Democrats, with Russian President Vladimir Putin calling them \u00e2\u20ac\u0153rubbish\u00e2\u20ac\u009d last week.\r\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The image [that Russia supports a candidate in the US presidential election] was created by the media,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Putin said at the Valdai Discussion Club in Sochi last Thursday, stressing that this had been done deliberately.\r\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is complete and utter rubbish, and it is just a method of internal political struggle, as well as a way of manipulating the public consciousness ahead of the US presidential elections,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d he added, while explaining that Russia does not prefer any particular candidate and is ready to work with either of them. Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president also stressed that friendly words and intentions to normalize relations between the US and Russia are always welcome, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153whoever expresses them.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\r\nSource",

What you hear a lot is that it\u2019s a bad choice, between an incompetent and a corrupt politician,\u201d said a former FBI official. \r\nSources who disputed the depth of Trump\u2019s internal support agreed that the FBI is now in parlous political territory.

Sie k\u00f6nnte den Austausch von E-Mails \u00fcber illegale Finanzmittelbeschaffungen oder Bestechungen umfassen oder auch \u00fcber die Verbindungen des Ehepaars Clinton zu den Muslimbr\u00fcdern und den Dschihadisten.\r\nVoltaire Netzwerk | Damaskus (Syrien) | 1.

Die Wiederaufnahme der FBI-Ermittlungen zum privaten E-Mail-Verkehr von Hillary Clinton ist nicht mehr auf Sicherheitsfragen gerichtet, sondern auf Mauscheleien, die bis zum Hochverrat gehen k\u00f6nnten.\r\nIn technischer Hinsicht hatte die Au\u00dfenministerin, statt einen gesicherten Server des Bundes zu benutzen, an ihrem Wohnsitz einen privaten Server einrichten lassen, um das Internet nutzen zu k\u00f6nnen, ohne auf einem Ger\u00e4t der Bundesregierung Spuren zu hinterlassen. Frau Clintons privater Techniker hatte vor der Ankunft des FBI ihren Server bereinigt, sodass es nicht m\u00f6glich war herauszufinden, warum sie diese Einrichtung hatte installieren lassen.\r\nIm ersten Anlauf hatte das FBI festgestellt, dass der private Server nicht die Sicherheitsvorkehrungen des Servers des Au\u00dfenministeriums aufwies. Frau Clinton hatte also nur einen Sicherheitsversto\u00df begangen. Im zweiten Schritt beschlagnahmte das FBI den Computer des ehemaligen Kongressmitglieds Anthony Weiner. Er ist der fr\u00fchere Ehemann von Huma Abedin, der Kabinettschefin von Hillary. Dort sind E-Mails wiedergefunden worden, die von der Au\u00dfenministerin stammen.\r\nAnthony Weiner ist ein den Clintons sehr nahestehender j\u00fcdischer Politiker, der B\u00fcrgermeister von New York werden wollte. Nach einem sehr puritanischen Skandal musste er aufgeben: Er hatte erotische SMS an eine junge Frau geschickt, die nicht seine Ehefrau war. Offiziell trennte sich Huma Abedin w\u00e4hrend dieser Turbulenzen von ihm, in Wirklichkeit verlie\u00df sie ihn aber nicht.\r\nHuma Abedin ist eine US-Amerikanerin, die in Saudi-Arabien aufgezogen wurde. Ihr Vater hat die Leitung einer akademischen Zeitschrift \u2013 f\u00fcr die sie jahrelang Redaktionsassistentin war \u2013, die regelm\u00e4\u00dfig die Ansichten der Muslimbr\u00fcder wiedergab. Ihre Mutter hat den Vorsitz in der saudischen Vereinigung der weiblichen Mitglieder der Muslimbruderschaft und arbeitete mit der Ehefrau des \u00e4gyptischen Pr\u00e4sidenten Morsi zusammen. Ihr Bruder Hassan arbeitet auf Rechnung von Scheich Yusuf al-Qaradawi, dem Prediger der Muslimbr\u00fcder und spirituellen Berater von Al-Jazeera.\r\nAnl\u00e4sslich einer offiziellen Reise nach Saudi-Arabien besucht die Au\u00dfenministerin in Begleitung der Vorsitzenden der Vereinigung der Muslimschwestern in der Bruderschaft, Saleha Abedin (Mutter der Kabinettschefin), das College Dar al-Hekma. Huma Abedin ist heute eine zentrale Pers\u00f6nlichkeit der Pr\u00e4sidentschaftskampagne Clintons an der Seite des Wahlkampfleiters John Podesta, dem ehemaligen Stabschef des Wei\u00dfen Hauses in der Amtszeit Bill Clintons. F\u00fcr die bescheidene Summe von 200.000 Dollar ist Podesta \u00fcbrigens im Kongress der st\u00e4ndige Lobbyist des saudi-arabischen K\u00f6nigreichs. Am 12. Juni 2016 hatte Petra, die amtliche Presseagentur Jordaniens, ein Interview mit dem arabischen Kronprinzen Mohammed bin Salman ver\u00f6ffentlicht, in dem er die Modernit\u00e4t seiner Familie damit unter Beweis stellte, dass sie illegal zu 20 Prozent die Pr\u00e4sidentschaftskampagne Hillary Clintons finanziert habe, obwohl sie eine Frau ist. Am Tag nach dieser Ver\u00f6ffentlichung zog die Agentur die Meldung zur\u00fcck und behauptete, ihre Webseite sei gehackt worden.\r\nLaut der amtlichen jordanischen Presseagentur Petra vom 12. Juni 2016 hat die saudische k\u00f6nigliche Familie illegal 20 Prozent der Pr\u00e4sidentschaftskampagne von Hillary Clinton finanziert. Frau Abedin ist nicht das einzige mit der Bruderschaft verbundene Mitglied der Obama-Regierung. Der Halbbruder des Pr\u00e4sidenten, Abon\u2019go Malik Obama, ist Schatzmeister des Missionswerks der Bruderschaft im Sudan und Vorsitzender der Stiftung Barack H. Obama. Er ist dem sudanesischen Pr\u00e4sidenten Omar el-Bechir direkt unterstellt. Ein Muslimbruder ist Mitglied im Nationalen Sicherheitsrat, der obersten exekutiven Instanz der Vereinigten Staaten. Von 2009 bis 2012 war dies Mehdi K. Alhassani. Es ist nicht bekannt, wer sein Nachfolger war, aber das Wei\u00dfe Haus leugnete, dass ein Muslimbruder im Sicherheitsrat sei, bis ein Beweis auftauchte. Auch der Botschafter der Vereinigten Staaten bei der Islamischen Konferenz, Rashad Hussain, ist Muslimbruder. Die anderen identifizierten Br\u00fcder besetzen weniger wichtige \u00c4mter. Doch muss Louay M.

Im April 2009, zwei Monate vor seiner Kairoer Rede, hatte Pr\u00e4sident Obama heimlich eine Delegation der Bruderschaft im Oval Office empfangen. Bereits bei seiner Amtseinf\u00fchrung hatte er Ingrid Mattson, die Vorsitzende der Vereinigung der muslimischen Br\u00fcder und Schwestern in den Vereinigten Staaten, eingeladen.\r\nDie Clinton-Stiftung hat ihrerseits als Verantwortlichen f\u00fcr ihr \u201eKlima\u201c-Projekt Gehad el-Haddad eingesetzt, einen der globalen F\u00fchrer der Bruderschaft, der bis dahin Leiter einer Koran-TV-Sendung war. Sein Vater war 1951 einer der Mitbegr\u00fcnder der Bruderschaft bei ihrer Neubildung durch die CIA und den MI6. Gehad verlie\u00df die Stiftung 2012 zu dem Zeitpunkt, als er in Kairo Sprecher des Kandidaten Mohammed Morsi wurde, dann offizieller Sprecher der Muslimbr\u00fcder weltweit.\r\nWenn man wei\u00df, dass die Gesamtheit der dschihadistischen F\u00fchrer auf der Welt entweder aus der Bruderschaft oder aus dem Sufi-Orden der Naqchbandis \u2013 die beiden Bestandteile der islamischen Weltliga, der saudischen antinationalistischen arabischen Organisation \u2013 hervorgegangen ist, w\u00fcsste man gern mehr \u00fcber die Beziehungen von Frau Clinton zu Saudi-Arabien und den Muslimbr\u00fcdern.\r\nNun befindet sich im Team ihres Herausforderers Donald Trump General Michael T.

Poor Carville was clearly apoplectic at the news of Comey\u2019s announcement, describing it as an assault or attack on American democracy multiple times. \r\n\r\nHe was also adamant about who was responsible. \u201cComey was acting in concert and coordination with the House Republicans,\u201d Carville said. \u201cWe also have the extraordinary case of the KGB being involved in this race and selectively leaking things from the Clinton campaign that they hacked,\u201d he claimed. \r\nCarville was very upset that Comey\u2019s announcement thrust Clinton\u2019s surely unethical and likely illegal behavior back into the spotlight. \u201cIt would seem to me that the FBI shouldn\u2019t be getting rolled by the House Republicans, that\u2019s what happened here \u2014 there\u2019s nothing else that\u2019s going on \u2014 and in the meantime \u2026 democracy is under assault by the KGB,\u201d he said. \u201cTo me that\u2019s something we ought to be talking about.\u201d \r\n\r\nUnfortunately for Carville, whilst fanciful tales about time-traveling Soviet spies and an FBI on the GOP\u2019s take certainly make for interesting entertainment, they pale in importance to the real life stories of Clinton\u2019s brazen lawlessness. \r\nWhen the MSNBC anchor dared raise the fact that Democrats were praising Comey only a few months ago when he announced the FBI\u2019s decision not to recommend indictment, Carville went into a stuttering, sputtering fit. Hillary Reboots \u2018Vast Right-Wing Conspiracy\u2019 Playbook Clinton camp set to wage effort to discredit FBI Director Comey and criminal probe as politically motivated \r\n\r\n\u201cWhen the facts change I change my mind,\u201d Carville said. \u201cWhy are you defending this, why are you sitting here as American democracy is under assault?\u201d he asked angrily. Faced with the Democrats\u2019 clear double standard \r\n\r\n\u201cThis is an unprecedented event that was done on behalf of the House Republicans,\u201d Carville repeated. \u201cAnd as we know the KGB is all over this election and this is what we are talking about?

    "body_en": "By Gordon Duff, Senior Editor on November 1, 2016 By Gordon Duff, Senior Editor and Ian Greenhalgh, Managing Editor \r\nJohn F. Kennedy memorably stated that he was going to smash the CIA into \u2018a thousand pieces\u2019, he had very good reasons for doing so; half a century later, it can reasonably be assumed that similar phrases are being darkly muttered within the corridors of power about the FBI. \r\nPresident George W. Bush \u201clost\u201d 22 million emails, many involving criminal investigations, and the FBI has said nothing, though the emails involved the White House used an illegal private server owned by the Republican Party for official government business. \r\nThe FBI is out to get Hillary Clinton, it\u2019s not Director Comey, Obama put him in there to clean up the mess, they\u2019ve been after Obama for 8 years. The \u2018birther\u2019 hoax began, no we aren\u2019t kidding, inside the FBI \u2013 it was the FBI that originated the wild rumour that Hillary Clinton murdered Vince Foster and that President Obama is not only a Muslim but many in the FBI actually say he\u2019s the anti-christ. \r\nLegal Analyst Paul Callan of CNN just published the following: \r\nLately, the FBI, while acting without the customary supervision of the Justice Department, appears to be a runaway train on a collision course with the concept of fairness in next week\u2019s presidential election. Democratic Senator Harry Reid and former White House ethics counsel Richard Painter have accused FBI Director James Comey of violating the Hatch Act by illegally using his office to influence the election. While the claim of a Hatch Act violation is a stretch, the appointment of an independent prosecutor and the replacement of Comey are nonetheless urgently required, if not outright overdue. The tangled relationship between the Clintons and Attorney General Loretta Lynch should have prompted appointment of an independent special prosecutor long ago.. \r\nHere\u2019s what Callan knew but wasn\u2019t able to write. The same informants that went to Callan also came to us and what they had to say was frightening. Here is how it began; an FBI insurrection and this is the exact term used by sources deep inside the FBI cabal, an FBI insurrection against, Comey, Hillary Clinton and Obama can no longer be safely ignored. This is why Senator Harry Reid has called for a criminal investigation of the FBI for violation of the Hatch Act. \r\nThe FBI, and this isn\u2019t Comey, it is the rank and file, the insurrectionist rank and file, a very powerful organisation that includes case managers, deputy directors that run not only counter-terrorism but financial crimes as well have not only targeted what they see to be dangerous liberal and progressive leaders, including of course the American president, but have continually protected criminals from prosecution as well. Those they have protected, possibly including names like Adelson, Trump and Romney, are funding moves against the US government, moves against American foreign policy and may well actually be funding recognised terror organisations as well, we have been specifically told this by sources within the FBI. \r\nThis insurrectional group within the FBI, which we are told includes the majority of FBI agents, has little idea what they have gotten into, some are aware they are taking orders from the shadowy Federalist Society, that \u2018right-wing conspiracy\u2019 Hillary Clinton referred to so many years ago as trying to bring down her husband\u2019s presidency, but it goes deeper, it gets scarier; it isn\u2019t just \u2018birthers\u2019. \r\nThe public face of this is blocked court appointments and a government in paralysis, but it\u2019s far deeper and far more threatening, it all became possible when two branches of government fell under the control of organised crime. It took a five/four rigged Supreme Court and a rigged election in 2000, covered up by the FBI, to subvert for all times the independence of America\u2019s legislature. Rigged by Richard Mellon Scaife, funded by Sheldon Adelson, a cabal calling themselves \u2018Neocons\u2019, in reality a front for organised crime, reapportioned Congressional districts across the US in clear violation of equal protection provisions of the constitution and backed by five mob-controlled members of the Supreme Court, bolstered by vote flipping software from the CIA, control of the legislative/investigative branch of government was permanently placed in the hands of a minority, destroying any hope of separation of powers and undermining all constitutional protections. Any hope of Americans influencing their own destiny disappeared with a rigged legislature running endless witch hunts and a mob-controlled Supreme Court backing them up. \r\nMaking it worse, so much worse, was the creation of a massive security bureaucracy, the Department of Homeland Security, laws authorising torture and illegal surveillance and the destruction of the FBI. \r\nNo public scandal can be investigated, no regulation enforced, no-one is left to speak up, no-one is safe from illegal arrest and imprisonment, a nightmare from the pages of Kafka become reality, all this has become clear in the last few days. \r\nWhen a prominent US senator calls for the prosecution of America\u2019s national police force, is it perhaps time to take note? \r\nThere was a reason the constitution prohibited the creation of the national police force, just as the constitution prohibited the creation of a central bank; there is no mechanism capable of controlling a central bank, as the failures of the Federal Reserve board and a cursory study of American history since 1913 will establish. \r\nSimilarly, no provision was established within the constitution to regulate or oversee a national police force, it didn\u2019t take long for the FBI to become the Cheka within a short period after it\u2019s creation, J. Edgar Hoover, turned \u2018the bureau\u2019 into a monstrosity blackmailing politicians and cosying up to crime figures while Hoover\u2019s FBI chased \u2018commies\u2019 both real and imaginary, it protected not only the mafia but powerful international crime cartels as well, becoming the real \u2018Murder Inc.\u2019 Taxpayer financed strong-arm thugs supported by a disinformation campaign. \r\nHoover gained control of the press almost immediately, keeping files on his press enemies, threatening and blackmailing; some of this was to protect his own secrets \u2013 mob ties and his notorious penchant for sexual deviance, now long in the public domain, but it went further \u2013 it was all about power. \r\n\u2018Mary\u2019 Hoover liked to dress as a woman and was infamously covertly photographed along with his longtime companion and lover Clyde Tolson in flagrante delicto; those photographs came into the possession of mob kingpin Meyer Lansky, thus ensnaring Hoover, and by extension the entire FBI in a dangerous marriage with the mob. There is no evidence they ever got divorced, though from time to time the relationship may have been somewhat rocky. \r\nSimply put, given these facts, any sense of surprise at FBI misconduct or calls for investigating or even disbanding the FBI, should be no surprise to anyone. Nearly every current television series that features scenarios involving the FBI invariably focuses on FBI corruption, the FBI\u2019s illegal involvement in politics and gross incompetence. \r\nSit at a table and have lunch with the FBI, it can go one of two ways \u2013 you can have brilliant, dedicated and relentless law enforcement officers who complain about being shackled by a corrupt bureaucracy, or like as not, a pack of delusional nutcases mouthing wild conspiracy theories and ranting about dangerous liberals; neither group, though widely divergent, make a case for the survival of the FBI. Then when you realise the Dept. of Homeland Security is entirely composed of conspiracy nutcases and other agencies are worse, it becomes clear that Harry Reid\u2019s demand to clean up the FBI is far from enough.",

Poor Carville was clearly apoplectic at the news of Comey\u2019s announcement, describing it as an assault or attack on American democracy multiple times.\u201cThis is in effect an attempt to hijack an election,\u201d Carville claimed. \u201cIt\u2019s unprecedented \u2026 the House Republicans and the KGB are trying to influence our democracy,\u201d he said. \r\nHe was also adamant about who was responsible. \u201cComey was acting in concert and coordination with the House Republicans,\u201d Carville said. \u201cWe also have the extraordinary case of the KGB being involved in this race and selectively leaking things from the Clinton campaign that they hacked,\u201d he added. \r\nCarville was very upset that Comey's announcement thrust Clinton's behavior back into the spotlight. \"It would seem to me that the FBI shouldn't be getting rolled by the House Republicans, that's what happened here \u2014 there's nothing else that's going on \u2014 and in the meantime \u2026 democracy is under assault by the KGB,\" he said. \"To me that's something we ought to be talking about.\" \r\nUnfortunately for Carville, fanciful tales about time-traveling Soviet spies and an FBI in the GOP's pocket certainly make for interesting entertainment \u2014 but they pale in importance to the real-life stories of Clinton's brazen lawlessness. \r\nWhen the MSNBC anchor dared raise the fact that Democrats were praising Comey only a few months ago when he announced the FBI's decision not to recommend indictment, Carville went into a stuttering, sputtering fit. \r\n\"When the facts change I change my mind,\" Carville said. \"Why are you defending this, why are you sitting here as American democracy is under assault?\" he asked. \r\n\"This is an unprecedented event that was done on behalf of the House Republicans,\" Carville repeated. \"And as we know the KGB is all over this election and this is what we are talking about?

Eleven days before the game-changing 2016 presidential election, FBI Director James Comey announces that his agency is reopening the criminal investigation of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton . \r\nAll of the expected angst and apoplexy from the Left come gushing out. An anti-Trump PAC issues a complaint against the FBI for interfering with the eletoral process .

    "body_en": "Hillary Reboots \u2018Vast Right-Wing Conspiracy\u2019 Playbook 10/31/2016 \r\nLIFEZETTE \r\nBefore even 24 hours had passed since the FBI director informed Congress on Friday that it was reopening the probe into Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails, Clinton suggested the director was in cahoots with the Republican Party. \r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made it very clear that, if they are going to be sending this kind of letter that is only going originally to Republican members of the House, that they need to share whatever facts they claim to have with the American people,\u201d Clinton said on Friday, after initially being blindsided by the FBI\u2019s announcement. \r\nThe claim wasn\u2019t true. All you had to do is turn the page and find Democratic members of Congress who had also received the letter from the FBI. But it shows how ready Clinton is to fight anyone in the government who dares investigate or question her. It is likely a habit Clinton picked up when she was first lady, from 1993 to 2001. \r\nClinton\u2019s opening salvo, though weak, is a sign of more to come. Her coming attack on the FBI and its director, James Comey, will likely begin in earnest on Monday, with her operatives using the letter to Congress as proof Clinton is the victim of a political conspiracy. \r\nClinton previewed her attack in Daytona Beach, Florida, on Saturday, when she said the letter was \u201cunprecedented and deeply troubling.\u201d \r\nClinton will also turn the issue into one of \u201ctransparency\u201d \u2014 even though FBI investigations are inherently not transparent. In Daytona, she called on Comey to \u201cexplain everything right away, put it all right on the table\u201d \u2014 a demand she knows will go unheeded. \r\nBut many of Clinton\u2019s allies in the media are likely to demand to see the emails found on former Rep. Anthony Weiner\u2019s laptop. \r\nIt\u2019s a strategy that could work, even with only a few days left until Election Day. \r\nSuch attacks on law enforcement worked fairly well for Clinton in 1998, when she and her husband, then-President Bill Clinton, vilified independent counsel Kenneth Starr. Starr had been tasked by Bill Clinton\u2019s own attorney general to investigate corruption charges, but likely rued the day he ever took the job. \r\nIn 1994, Bill Clinton faced questions from many, including The New York Times, about an investment the Clintons made in a company called Whitewater Development Corp. Bill Clinton\u2019s attorney general, Janet Reno, made Robert Fiske the independent counsel. \r\nFiske would later be replaced by Starr. Starr\u2019s investigation would later reach into charges that President Clinton had lied in the Paula Jones sexual harassment civil trial. With explosive charges being published by the Drudge Report and Newsweek in January 1998 that Bill Clinton had seduced an intern, Monica Lewinsky, the Clintons could have been expected to admit the truth and take the punishments. \r\nInstead, the Clinton White House and the Democrats began attacking Starr and the Republicans. \r\nOn Jan. 27, 1998, Hillary Clinton went on NBC\u2019s \u201cThe Today Show\u201d and goaded the press into covering the opposition rather than President Bill Clinton, who had lied about his affair with Lewinsky just one day earlier. \r\nMatt Lauer asked if Hillary Clinton had said the fight against Starr would be the \u201clast great battle\u201d of the Clinton White House. \r\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve been that dramatic,\u201d Hillary Clinton replied. \u201cBut I do believe that this is a battle. I mean, look at the very people who are involved in this \u2014 they have popped up in other settings. This is \u2014 the great story here for anybody willing to find it and write about it and explain it is this vast right-wing conspiracy that has been conspiring against my husband since the day he announced for president.\u201d \r\nThe Starr report on the Clinton scandals was released months later. But what the Clintons are really proud of that is that the Democrats actually gained seats in the 1998 midterm elections, helping to cause a backfire against the GOP. \r\nThe GOP didn\u2019t have anywhere near the two-thirds majority in the Senate to remove Bill Clinton. In early 1999, the U.S. Senate acquitted Bill Clinton on two charges: obstruction of justice, and perjury. \r\nIt taught the Clintons the wrong lesson: to fight authorities if authorities questioned them \u2014 even authorities within the Democratic Party. Clinton will be targeting and attacking President Obama\u2019s own FBI director as Obama leaves office.",

Israel makes \u2018Hail Mary\u2019 move to influence US election \u2013 FBI commit treason? By Ian Greenhalgh on October 28, 2016 According to New York Times, federal officials discovered new emails in a separate review of the former NY Jewish congressman Huma Abedin and Anthony Weiner in happier times [Editor\u2019s note: As Gordon wrote yesterday, in his coverage of the Alex Jones attempt to boost Trump\u2019s shattered credibility, Israel and the Zionist cabal are getting desperate, time is running out for them to influence the election in favour of their candidate. We have been expecting some kind of \u2018October Surprise\u2019 to happen, some kind of attempt to fatally undermine the Clinton campaign just as they did in 1979 to Jimmy Carter, a move that allowed them to get their candidate, Ronald Reagan, into office and we all know what that lead to \u2013 incredible damage to the US in so many ways. Reagan destroyed the credibility of the US on the world stage, he hugely increased military budgets, rigged the system in favour of the banks and big corporations, destroyed the economy, waged war on behalf of the cabal, overall he was a disaster for the US and it\u2019s people. However, Reagan was just an actor playing a role, a puppet for the Zionist crime cabal, put in power by their intrigues and it was Roy Cohn who was behind it all, he was the enabler, the man who made it all happen. Today, the same thing is happening again, Cohn is long gone, but the Judeo-Zionist mafia \u2013 the \u2018Kosher Nostra\u2019 is still alive and well and they are attempting to repeat the same tricks that got their man Reagan into the White House. Do not forget for one second that Donald Trump was created by Roy Cohn and like Reagan, Trump is just an actor playing a role; he is not a billionaire successful businessman, he just plays one on TV. He is not at all a massively wealthy man, his main source of income is NBC and his reality TV show; he does of course, have assets, but how many of those does he really own? In most cases he is just the front man, the real owners of his assets being silent partners who are invariably, members of the Kosher Nostra. We have watched in disgust as Israel, via their Mossad disinfo operation Wikileaks have released more and more emails taken from Hilary\u2019s email server. Invariably these emails have been modified, \u2018sexed up\u2019 in order to make Hilary look bad, all in an attempt to influence the US election in favour of Trump. As we have written several times already, there are no white hat hackers passing this info to Wikileaks, rather, the NSA has been monitoring all communications, passing the raw data to Tel-Aviv where the Mossad have filtered and vetted it in order to find anything they can use against Hilary, always with something added to make them seem more damning. This makes the NSA guilty of treason, they are aiding and abetting a hostile foreign power in it\u2019s attempts to exert a nefarious influence over US politics. Today, with this new set of emails, the FBI has joined them in committing treason; make no mistake, the timing and nature of this latest \u2018revelation\u2019 is a most cynical attempt to swing things in favour of Trump and in announcing this investigation with just 10 days to go until polling day, the FBI have acted on behalf of Israel. The reason Hilary was using a private server in the first place was to attempt to keep her important communications away from the prying eyes of the Israelis, an act which shows that her loyalty is to the US and it\u2019s people rather than to Israel, this sets her apart from the majority in Washington and brings her into the crosshairs of the Zionist cabal. It remains to be seen what the result of this new FBI email investigation will be, but I cannot escape the uncomfortable feeling that the Zionists have played a Hail Mary and may just score a touchdown that lands Trump in office and condemns the US and it\u2019s people to even worse Zionist oppression than ever before. A truly frightening scenario. Ian]",

    "body_en": "Huma Abedin Sent Top Secret Docs To Yahoo Acct, Possible \u2018Life Insurance\u2019 Posted on October 31, 2016 by Rebecca Diserio in Politics Share This \r\nA laptop, allegedly belonging to Huma Abedin\u2019s estranged husband Anthony Weiner, reportedly had thousands of emails from Hillary Clinton\u2019s private server as possible \u201clife insurance\u201d against the corrupt Democrat. We\u2019ve uncovered shocking details behind what Huma did and why she did it as well as explosive information about FBI Director James Comey\u2019s secret war that the liberal media is keeping from you. Huma Abedin (left), Hillary Clinton (middle), Anthony Weiner (right) \r\nAfter the New York Police Department was notified about Anthony Weiner sexting an underage girl, they had to investigate, and it was then that they discovered a laptop with over 650,000 \u201cmetadata points\u201d and about 10,000 emails overall, which were from the State Department and coming from Hillary Clinton\u2019s home based server. Huma Abedin most probably kept those emails hidden on that laptop for life insurance against evil Hillary: \r\n[W]as the laptop in question one of the missing laptops from the Clinton email investigation? One can easily imagine a scenario where this could be the case \u2026 One can also easily imagine a scenario where the content therein would be kept by Abedin for a reason; especially by a person who knows EVERYTHING about the extent the severe black hat Clinton\u2019s are willing to go to retain their power. [via The Conservative Treehouse ] \r\nThe leaks in this new investigation involving Huma Abedin are coming from the New York police, probably a few detectives who were shocked when they found top secret documents on the laptop when investigating Anthony Weiner, and they are driving the FBI to move forward because, if the bureau doesn\u2019t, they will come out and tell all Americans what they know. Also, there is clear evidence that FBI agents were in revolt after Hillary was let off scot-free, and they were going to leak this information too, if Comey did not re-open the investigation. \r\nWhat is it they know? They know Huma Abedin was probably keeping insurance in case Hillary ever turned on her, and Huma was thinking the FBI investigation was over and no one would ever find that laptop with her \u201clife insurance.\u201d Then in late September, Weiner did his illegal sexting thing, and before Huma could collect the laptop with the secret documents, the New York police had seized it. Huma Abedin\u2019s testimony, subpoenaed by Judicial Watch. She admits to using her Yahoo email account for State Department business. \r\nJust 11 days before Comey rocked the world on October 28th, announcing he was re-opening the email investigation, he sent out a clue that this is what he was going to do, but we all missed it . Check out this shocking FBI report that Comey released just 11 days ago about Hillary Clinton, which he called the final report on the email scandal: Page(s) 43, 44, 45 \u2013 Show aspects of the perspective of Secretary Clinton as she rebukes her security apparatus and puts her diplomatic team at risk. Also the alarming influence of Huma Abedin into security and protocol changes. Page 49 \u2013 Discusses the people within the highly secretive \u201c7th Floor Group,\u201d and how they handle security information Page 54 \u2013 Discusses the missing boxes of printed Clinton Emails. Page 56 \u2013 Discusses how the Secretary of State\u2019s Office runs a secondary U.S. government , separate and apart from the traditional political structure, actually called \u201cthe shadow government.\u201d FBI Director James Comey finds himself all alone, fighting against Hillary and her cabal. \r\n\u201cA shadow government ,\u201d what the hell is going on? This sounds like some nutjob conspiracy theory, yet this is exactly what Comey released to the American people on October 17th. He was letting us know that Hillary and her cabal are evil and they need to go. \r\nI think James Comey is the hero in all of this. At first, we hated him because it seemed he had given into the Obama administration\u2019s evil ways, but all along, he kept fighting, and when Anthony Weiner dropped that laptop at Comey\u2019s feet, it was like a gift from God himself. \r\nThe fight isn\u2019t over. We are seeing Hillary and her minions fight back against this new investigation, and I think Comey still has his hands tied, but he is doing what he can. Hopefully, those FBI agents and New York cops who are privy to what it is in Huma\u2019s Yahoo email \u201clife insurance\u201d file will leak the information before the election. \r\nWe can see, without any doubt, from Comey\u2019s \u201cfinal report\u201d that Hillary is a tyrant and she must never be in power again. Let\u2019s spread all this information because the strongest defense against Hillary\u2019s evil is the truth, and as more Americans learn this truth, there is no way she will win.",

When top DC insiders meet with oil and defense contractors, be it a \u201cprayer breakfast\u201d or \u201chunting society\u201d or to dance around a fire somewhere wearing horned headgear, the FBI is there. \r\nCalls for a special prosecutor to investigate possible FBI involvement in attempts to rig this years presidential election have more to them than meet the eye. A culture of corruption has infected the FBI to the point where they have become a danger to national security. Let\u2019s be clear, the majority of FBI agents are not only competent and honest, they are fine people. However, this is a deeply political group, strongly right wing, with a very secretive hierarchy that has not only taken sides in the election, but has been involved in covering up terrorist acts and organized crime for years. \r\nRecently, CNN called for a special prosecutor to investigate the FBI. There is a reason for this, which we will get into, not at some small risk. CNN also reported on \u201cfake news\u201d and the threat it entails. What if I told you that the majority of FBI agents, including highest level officials, were not only \u201cbirthers,\u201d a belief even Trump now has backed away from, but openly talk about murders they believe Hillary Clinton has committed or continue to insist that President Obama is a Muslim? Worse still, many actually insist that Barack Obama is the anti-Christ. \r\nNot only are those who run America\u2019s most powerful law enforcement organization rooted in conspiracy theories and delusions, they are continually hoaxed by fake news stories. \r\nWorse still, the FBI has, for years, covered for financial criminals, the payday loan scams, the mortgage \u201crobo-signers\u201d and more. When America\u2019s savings and loans were crashed by fraud during the Reagan administration, costing $1.4 trillion, few went to jail. This may have been the beginning. When, in 2007, America\u2019s investment banking system collapsed, the price of that nearing $10 trillion, all of which involved criminal fraud on an unimaginable scale, all that could be done was a \u201cbail out,\u201d but no prosecutions though nearly half the equity value of the entire nation had been redirected overseas by an international criminal cabal. \r\nThis is the same FBI, under the guidance of Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, that got behind torture, kidnapping and illegal surveillance. \r\nWhere we are now is this, organized crime at the highest levels is free to operate in the US with impunity while the FBI runs political witch hunts under the direction of right wing extremist groups. \r\nWe are told that the FBI helped squash the 9/11 investigations, including releasing certain suspects tied to foreign intelligence services along with a series of investigations tied to voter intimidation, voting machine hacking and the death of Michael Connell , which would have brought down the Bush presidency. \r\nRead today\u2019s New York Times about Donald Trump\u2019s income taxes, where the term \u201cimproper\u201d is used when describing Trump\u2019s taking huge tax deductions for losses by others. Even the Times is afraid of using the term \u201ccriminal.\u201d It isn\u2019t Trump they are afraid of. Gambling boss Sheldon Adelson just gave Trump $25m today, dirty money to bolster a flagging campaign, donated after the FBI attempt to down Clinton with a phony email scandal failed miserably due to VT investigative reporting . \r\nVT\u2019s allegations have now all been supported, and sources are coming forward about much more serious problems within the FBI and real threats to national security. \r\nThe Federalists \r\nThere is both a public and private version of the Federalist Society. They organize high school debates, the recruit \u201clike minded conservatives\u201d to go to law school or in law schools, they push \u201cright minded\u201d lawyers into key positions in politics, in the courts and in the FBI. There\u2019s the rub. There is a dark side to the federalists as well, agenda drive and very \u201canti-government,\u201d as much as any militia, in fact \u201cout neoconning\u201d the neocons hands down. \r\nThe Federalist Society is powerful, embedded everywhere and operating with a grand plan, one that involves something beyond tyranny as we know it, the full unabridged version of the corporate state where superior man is allowed his way and others, well, they learn to lie down and take it. \r\nThis is conservatism, or \u201cneo-conservatism\u201d as it exists, not on the news but in real life, elitism at the hands of self proclaimed elites \u201cin their own minds,\u201d empowered mama\u2019s boys, ass kissers and the kids that hung around the teacher\u2019s skirts during recess so they wouldn\u2019t get their tiny little asses handed to them by regular children. \r\nThe Plot \r\nWhat if congress were controlled by the Federalists? What if the Federalists controlled, until Scalia was killed anyway, the Supreme Court as well? What if the Federalists organized congress to block judicial appointments, in order to run the courts and control key cases around the country for paying clients, some drug cartels, defense companies but more often big polluters, drug companies and banks, the kind of banks that robo-sign mortgages and bilk customers out of their savings. \r\nThe Federalists run the FBI, having taken over after pushing aside the Mormon contingent, still alive and well but less powerful, that was put in place by Hoover. \r\nHere\u2019s the rub, we have seen congress do little during the Obama presidency but run investigations, some of them like Benghazi, built on \u201cfake news\u201d and internet conspiracies. We also mentioned that the FBI, rather than being a collection of elitist lawyers and big IQ guys, is now Fox News conspiracy junkies who, after 9/11, ate the entire donut cart of fantasy fed to the general public and have, for more than a decade, chased shadows and fought a war on terror against organization that never existed. \r\nWhere this applies now is in what we have seen over the past few days. We have established the \u201ccrying liberal goodguy\u201d credentials of James Comey, FBI Director. We know he hates torture, fought against, for awhile at least, the surveillance state and certainly convinced President Obama that he was going to be able to clean up the FBI after its long descent into disrepute during the Bush/Gonzales period. \r\nFor years, every time Alex Jones or some other podcaster or blogger, a \u201cfake news\u201d generator came up with a tale about Hillary Clinton, Congress put millions on the table and began the witch hunt. The version of Benghazi that congress chases around and the one the intelligence agencies know is real are so unrelated as to share almost no facts at all. Everything about Libya was secret, including the shotgun wedding between Gaddaffi and Bush/Blair, a sick threesome involving not just arms dealing but a covert nuclear weapons program, germ warfare labs and surrogate terrorism to be blamed on others, like Syria. \r\nWhere it gets dangerous is here, we have congress controlled by the GOP, a mix of Tea Party true believers, with the wild eyed look worn down a bit and the \u201cI am for sale, name a price\u201d written on their fat pink little pig faces. \r\nMix in the usual suspects, the \u201cWashington types,\u201d running when told, where told, fully at the services of the lobby, Israel, big Pharma, the drug cartels who top off their Bain Capital/Cayman Islands bank accounts\u2026 \r\nAdd to that, the endless obstructionism, the endless investigations and, wait for it, an FBI now controlled by the Federalist Society, the name group that runs the congressional investigations and manages the payoffs as well. \r\nThen Obama throws Comey into the mix. Here is what we are told; Comey killed the expected prosecution of Hillary not because the investigation showed she didn\u2019t commit crimes but because the investigation showed very much that she had committed many crimes, but for one minor problem. The investigation itself was corrupt, fabricating evidence, intimidating witnesses and falsifying everything it touched. The Federalists expected Comey to bend over as he had so many times in the past. Instead, he simply threw it all out. \r\nThe leaders of the FBI cabal met at a contractors ranch in Montana to discuss how to get not only Hillary but Comey as well. The deal was this, take a batch of emails that were \u201cout there,\u201d and there were hundreds of thousands unaccounted for. Seed classified information into them, for \u201csecurity\u2019s sake\u201d like had been done before, something Comey caught onto when he killed the FBI\u2019s case against Hillary. \r\nThen to do two things, crash the election and get rid of Comey. With Trump coming in, if things work out, Comey will be replaced with a puppet of choice and the Federalist run FBI will be unleashed to blackmail, torture and fabricate evidence until caught and there will be nobody left to speak up. \r\nWorking hand in hand with them will be congress and pouring money in, the drug cartels, the Israel/Saudi/Turkish lobby, big oil and maybe even the Russians as well, who knows. The sky is the limit. This is just like the good old days with Nixon. \r\nSetting up Comey was easy. Get the emails, put them on Weiner\u2019s computer and fail to legally gain access to them by not applying for a search warrant. Then go to Comey telling him they were just found. With his weak constitution and the abuse he got from Trump\u2019s people, combined with the \u201cline agent insurrection\u201d (yes, this is the term used) for standing up against them once, Comey would fold. \r\nComey folded, he took the bait and ran to congress with the weeks old illegally obtained probably seeded and falsified evidence that has burned down his career. \r\nWith calls for FBI Director James Comey to step down and accusations of FBI corruption from both the Trump and Clinton campaigns, sources have begun to come forward. What we are hearing, primarily from inside the FBI but from Washington insiders of both parties, will shake the very foundations of the republic. We begin: \r\nWhat We Know \r\nJames Comey has a history as a reformer and advocate of constitutional rights. In 2004, he was brought into the Bush Department of Justice but soon found much amiss and became a critic of torture, rendition and \u201ccooked\u201d terror cases. President Obama believed he was pulling a fast one by moving Comey, a Republican, into the slot as FBI director. Comey was tasked with reforming the Bureau, which had begun \u201ccowboying\u201d cases and making up the rules, widely abusing even its broadened powers under anti-terror legislation that many legal experts cite as being unconstitutional. To many in the FBI, the Patriot Acts and FISA weren\u2019t tyrannical enough. \r\nThe FBI is overrun with factions and some of them are closely tied to extremist groups that advocate the overthrow of the United States government. \r\nLet\u2019s be clear, most FBI agents are lawyers, many are experienced law enforcement officers and, typically, the majority are frighteningly honest, a bit dull and very right wing. Most FBI agents are \u201cbirthers,\u201d and still believe that President Obama is a Muslim and was born in Kenya, though there is no evidence, whatsoever, to imply that either assertion has merit. \r\nStill they believe this. In discussions with FBI agents and ranking FBI officials, invariably they are horribly uninformed on international affairs and seem as though they get their ideas about terror threats from TV shows. Most are not rooted in reality, not by standards of an intelligence agency or military command. The FBI has developed a closed culture, almost cult-like, where influences are often extremist, sometimes religious and were the organs of oversight and control have broken down. \r\nThe FBI can\u2019t be trusted. \r\nThe public knows that Director Comey wrote a letter to congress where he expressed an obligation to inform congress of evidence he had just received that indicated that not all emails between former Secretary of State Clinton and others, sent through a private server, had been evaluated for potential criminal elements. The letter went no further. \r\nComey had been warned not to send the letter, advised may be a better term, by Attorney General Loretta Lynch and other officials, making their case that he is not authorized to released such information and that the timing of this was highly suspect and this act would damage the reputation of the FBI. \r\nLynch was unaware that the emails had, in fact, been around for a up to a month. She was alway unaware that they had been illegally downloaded or \u201csynced\u201d into Anthony Weiner\u2019s computer. She was further unaware that existing search warrants made viewing or evaluating these emails, in any way, no matter how they had been accessed, was illegal. \r\nThus, when Comey commented in his letter about the basic nature of the emails, information only available through a process that violated law, he moved into the area of gross misconduct, perhaps criminal misconduct and left himself open for accusations of Hatch Act violation. The basis Comey applied for rationalizing his act was predicated on these points: A valid search warrant that covered these emails was in place. It was not. These emails had been, in fact, already in the hard drive and were not placed there, \u201cplanted\u201d or \u201csynced\u201d by the FBI. If Comey were told this or failed to ask or make certain, the standard for conspiracy and obstruction charges exist within his office and the case management team at the FBI. Comey based his letter on what he claimed was his belief that these emails had just been discovered. In fact they had been around for as long as five weeks, a fact that raises more questions: Why did Comey wait until just prior to an election? Who did he talk to? What transpired during this period? Why did Comey not as for a search warrant to review the emails, though we know the process, or at least a cursory and quite illegal process had already begun, until after he wrote his letter and was bombarded with criticism? \r\nA powerful group of FBI agents, opposed to Hillary Clinton, a group that includes extremists tied to the are the force behind the bizarre letter Director James Comey wrote to Congress last Friday, which have led to calls for his resignation and even arrest. \r\n\r\nThe FBI claims it knew of the Weiner/Abedin emails as early as September 22, 2016 and had certainly accessed them, without a warrant, by October 3 or 4. \r\nDirector Comey\u2019s letter to Congress makes reference to knowledge that could only be obtained by reviewing minimally header material but also limited text in the emails, which he makes note of, though there is no legal basis for him having any information at all, as no warrant was issued until yesterday. \r\nYesterday, Comey announced that the emails had been held for some time. If this is true, it was done without his knowledge, a serious breach of national security. If he did know, it is for Comey to show how he dealt with that knowledge for the past 30 days, with whom he conferred and why he waited. This is where Senator Reid finds basis for citing Comey as in criminal violation of the Hatch Act and sees likely intent on Comey\u2019s part to rig an election. \r\n\r\nThings in Washington are coming apart as a pattern of \u201ccowboying,\u201d up to and including criminal acts, planting evidence, Hatch Act violations, perjury and obstruction may well have infected the FBI. Sources indicate that \u201cline agents\u201d within the FBI who either support the Trump candidacy or strongly oppose Hillary Clinton, are using the Bureau to try to rig this year\u2019s presidential election, an assertion now echoing around Washington. \r\nThe Hillary email issues, cited by Senator Harry Reid (D) Utah as a violation of the Hatch Act, Federal employees involved in rigging an election, is only the tip of the iceberg. Yesterday, FBI Director James Comey admitted that he didn\u2019t know agents had withheld emails by Clinton aide, Huma Abedin, that he mistakenly reported to congress as a recent discovery. \r\nIn fact, not only had the agents held these emails for weeks, as early as September 22, 2016, they had failed to ask for a warrant to even view them. Moreover, the acquisition of the emails itself was, according to numerous sources, an abuse of a warrant. Worse still, as the emails weren\u2019t actually even on the computer but were loaded to it, and then misrepresented as being \u201cfound\u201d on the computer\u2019s hard drive. \r\nPractices like this were commonplace during the second Bush administration and it was James Comey that was brought in to institute reforms and end the procedural abuses that had become rampant inside the Bureau. After 9/11 sweeping changes in surveillance legislation and broadly expanded powers instilled in many agents, according to sources in the Department of Justice, a broad disrespect for constitutional guarantees. \r\n\u201cThey went a bit nuts there, and by the time Ashcroft (Attorney General) tried to rein them in, it was too late. Ashcroft was sick and was eventually pushed out by even stronger advocates of enhanced interrogation and the rule of the day, \u201crounding up the usual suspects,\u201d guilty or not, in order to make the papers and sell more terror legislation.\u201d",

    "body_en": "Failed Investigations of JFK\u2019s Murder November 21, 2016 \r\nMore than a half century later, John F. Kennedy\u2019s assassination still resonates not only because of its historical importance but because the investigation was more a cover-up than a pursuit of truth, says researcher Gary Aguilar. \r\nBy Gary Aguilar \r\nNovember 22 marks the 53 rd anniversary of John F. Kennedy\u2019s assassination. If history is any guide, it\u2019s likely some mainstream outlet will commemorate that dark day with reassurances that the Warren Commission was right that Lee Harvey Oswald did it alone, and that most doubters, who have been in the majority since the mid-1960s, are randy conspiracy theorists. That is the essential message by one of the experts likely to be cited this year, attorney Howard Willens. President John F. Kennedy in the motorcade through Dallas shortly before his assassination on Nov. 22, 1963. (Photo credit: Walt Cisco, Dallas Morning News) \r\nOne of the few still-living Warren Commission staffers, Willens followed up his 2013 book, History Will Prove Us Right, with a spirited defense of the Commission in the summer, 2016 issue of the journal, The American Scholar , which he co-wrote with another Commission staffer, attorney Richard Mosk. The piece , \u201cThe Truth About Dallas, \u201d is a celebration of the work and conclusions of the original investigation. \r\nBut Willens\u2019s and Mosk\u2019s defense of the work of the Warren Commission they served on is more notable for what they omit from the official record than what they include. \u201cWhat the critics often forget or ignore,\u201d they write, \u201cis that since 1964, several government agencies have also looked at aspects of our work,\u201d (p. 59) as if the Church Committee and the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) had reviewed and applauded the Commission\u2019s work. \r\nIndeed, they did look at it. But rather than plaudits, they issued stinging rebukes, principally for the Commission\u2019s having been rolled by FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, and to a lesser extent, by the CIA and the Secret Service. \r\n\u201cIt must be said that the FBI generally exhausted its resources in confirming its case against Oswald as the lone assassin,\u201d the HSCA concluded, \u201ca case that Director J. Edgar Hoover, at least, seemed determined to make within 24 hours of the of the assassination.\u201d \r\nIn essence, the experienced investigators concluded that Hoover had divined the solution to the crime before starting the inquiry, and then his agents confirmed the boss\u2019s epiphany. The intimidated Warren Commission went right along. FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover \r\nAnd with good reason, only part of which Willens and Mosk tell. They admit that the \u201cFBI had originally opposed the creation of the Warren Commission\u201d and that Hoover \u201cordered investigations of commission staff members.\u201d But they don\u2019t tell that Hoover deployed one of his favorite dirty tricks to deal not only with support staffers, such as Willens and Mosk, but also with the commissioners themselves. \r\n\u201c[D]erogatory information pertaining to both Commission members and staff was brought to Mr. Hoover\u2019s attention,\u201d the Church Committee reported . (emphasis added) \r\nHoover\u2019s Spy \r\nWillens and Mosk also forgot to mention that Hoover had a personal spy on the Warren Commission, then Rep. Gerald Ford, who tattled on Commissioners who were (justifiably) skeptical of the Bureau\u2019s work. \r\n\u201cFord indicated he would keep me thoroughly advised as to the activities of the Commission,\u201d FBI Agent Cartha DeLoach wrote in a once secret memo. \u201cHe stated this would have to be done on a confidential basis, however he thought it should be done.\u201d Autopsy photo of President John F. Kennedy. \r\nAt the bottom of the memo, Hoover scrawled , \u201cWell handled.\u201d The success of Hoover\u2019s machinations was obvious to subsequent government investigators. (Ford, of course, later became President upon the resignation of Richard Nixon in 1974.) \r\nThe HSCA\u2019s chief counsel, Notre Dame Law Professor Robert Blakey, a criminal investigator and prosecutor with vastly better credentials than either Willens or Mosk, was impressed with neither the Commission\u2019s vigor nor its independence. \r\n\u201cWhat was significant,\u201d Blakey determined, \u201cwas the ability of the FBI to intimidate the Commission, in light of the Bureau\u2019s predisposition on the questions of Oswald\u2019s guilt and whether there had been a conspiracy. At a January 27 [1964] Commission meeting, there was another dialogue [among Warren Commissioners]: \r\n\u201cJohn McCloy: \u2018\u2026 the time is almost overdue for us to have a better perspective of the FBI investigation than we now have \u2026 We are so dependent on them for our facts \u2026 .\u2019 \r\n\u201cCommission counsel J. Lee Rankin: \u2018Part of our difficulty in regard to it is that they have no problem. They have decided that no one else is involved \u2026 .\u2019 \r\n\u201cSenator Richard Russell: \u2018They have tried the case and reached a verdict on every aspect.\u2019 \r\n\u201cSenator Hale Boggs: \u2018You have put your finger on it.\u2019 (Closed Warren Commission meeting.)\u201d [Blakey & Billings, Fatal Hour\u2013 The Assassination of President . See also: North, Act of Treason ] \r\nTestifying before the HSCA, the Warren Commission\u2019s chief counsel J. Lee Rankin shamefully admitted , \u201cWho could protest against what Mr. Hoover did back in those days?\u201d Apparently not President Lyndon Johnson\u2019s blue-ribbon commissioners. \r\nThe HSCA\u2019s Blakey also reported that \u201cWhen asked if he was satisfied with the (Commission\u2019s) investigation that led to the (no conspiracy) conclusion, Judge Burt Griffin (a Commission staff member) said he was not.\u201d [Blakey & Billings, Ibid.] \r\nAnd author Gus Russo reported that Judge Griffin also admitted, \u201cWe spent virtually no time investigating the possibility of conspiracy. I wish we had.\u201d [Russo, Live by the Sword ] \r\nClear Misgivings \r\nThus, despite their clear misgivings, the Commissioners bowed to the imperious FBI chief rather than conduct a thorough investigation. Notably, the Commission never once employed a rudimentary investigative tool . \u201cThe Commission,\u201d the HSCA reported, \u201cfailed to utilize the instruments of immunity from prosecution and prosecution for perjury with respect to witnesses whose veracity it doubted.\u201d [US Cong. House of Reps. Report of Comm. on Assassinations, 1979] Lee Harvey Oswald, the accused assassin of President John F. Kennedy. \r\nThis policy had serious repercussions when the Commission confronted two key issues: published claims that Lee Harvey Oswald had been an FBI informant, and the possibility that Jack Ruby was mobbed up. \r\n\u201cThe Commission did not investigate Hoover or the FBI, and managed to avoid the appearance of doing so,\u201d the HSCA determined . \u201cIt ended up doing what the members had agreed they would not do: Rely mainly on the FBI\u2019s denial of the allegations (that Oswald had been a Bureau informant).\u201d \r\nHoover merely sent the Commission his signed affidavit declaring that Oswald was not an informant and also \u201csent over 10 additional affidavits from each FBI agent who had had contact with Oswald.\u201d And with that, case closed. \r\nRegarding Jack Ruby, the FBI had his phone records, yet failed to spot Ruby\u2019s obvious, and atypical, pattern of calls to known Mafiosi in the weeks leading up to the assassination. After performing the simple, obvious task of actually analyzing those calls, the HSCA determined that, if not a sworn member of La Cosa Nostra, Ruby had ongoing, close links to numerous Mafiosi. \r\nThus the HSCA roundly rejected the Warren Commission\u2019s conclusion that, \u201cthe evidence does not establish a significant link between Ruby and organized crime.\u201d \r\nThe list of Warren Commission shortcomings that the HSCA assembled is not short. A brief summary of them runs some 47 pages in the Bantam Books version of the report (p. 289\u2013336), which outlines what required much of the 500 pages of HSCA volume XI to cover ( available on-line ). \r\n\u201cThe evidence indicates that facts which may have been relevant to, and would have substantially affected, the Warren Commission\u2019s investigation were not provided by the agencies (FBI and the CIA). Hence, the Warren Commission\u2019s findings may have been formulated without all of the relevant information.\u201d \r\nThe Church Committee said that the problem was that \u201cthe Commission was perceived as an adversary by both Hoover and senior FBI officials.\u201d \u201cSuch a relationship,\u201d the Committee dryly observed , \u201cwas not conductive to the cooperation necessary for a thorough and exhaustive investigation.\u201d \r\nBut the FBI did more than just withhold evidence from the Commission. Although they admit that the FBI destroyed a note Oswald wrote to Agent Hosty, and withheld that information from the Commission, Willens and Mosk don\u2019t mention that Agent Hosty reported that his own personnel file, and other FBI files, had been falsified. [Hosty, Jr. Assignment: Oswald ] \r\nNor that author Curt Gentry learned from assistant FBI director William Sullivan that there were other JFK documents at the Bureau that had been destroyed. [Gentry, J. Edgar Hoover\u2013 The Man and His Secrets ] \r\nPerhaps one of the reasons the public has remained mistrustful of the government\u2019s conclusions, and the mainstream media reassurances, is the sort of selective presentation of evidence by ax grinders like Willens and Mosk who get heralded by our \u201cresponsible\u201d media. \r\nGary Aguilar is one of the few physicians outside the government ever allowed to see the still-restricted JFK autopsy photos and X-rays. He has published and lectured on the topic of the JFK assassination for many years.",

    "title_en": "American Nightmare: Tyranny Under the FBI, an American Reality (Part III)",
    "body_en": "By Gordon Duff, Senior Editor on November 3, 2016 Hoover and Tolson \r\nWhen Supreme Court Justice John Scalia died, under mysterious circumstances, FBI officials were there. It was the FBI that blocked the autopsy of a Supreme Court Justice, required by law to be supervised by the Surgeon General of the United States. \r\nThe organization Scalia belonged to and was with when he died, or was murdered as some assert, includes top leaders of all American business sectors along with government officials, both elected and \u201ccareer,\u201d who regularly meet and plan the overthrow of the American government. \r\nThe Trump team includes the public persona of Rudy Guiliani, tasked with organizing the FBI revolt, wielding bushels of cash from the Saudis and the Adelson gambling/trafficking empire. Guiliani and his friends control most post-retirement employment for FBI agents, all of which filters through firms connected to or represented by his law firm. The FBI is, in fact, controlled by Rudy Guiliani, according to some sources. \r\nWe saw the tip of that this week when Rudy Guiliani, according to the Daily Beast , reached inside the FBI and moved them clearly into the Trump campaign. Illegal though these acts are, as you may read below, they openly bragged about it. You see, with Congress and the FBI under control, investigations are a tool of punishment and intimidation only: \r\n\u201cTwo days before FBI director James Comey rocked the world last week, Rudy Giuliani was on Fox, where he volunteered, un-prodded by any question: \u201cI think he\u2019s [Donald Trump] got a surprise or two that you\u2019re going to hear about in the next few days. I mean, I\u2019m talking about some pretty big surprises.\u201d Pressed for specifics, he said: \u201cWe\u2019ve got a couple of things up our sleeve that should turn this thing around.\u201d \r\nThe man who now leads \u201clock-her-up\u201d chants at Trump rallies spent decades of his life as a federal prosecutor and then mayor working closely with the FBI, and especially its New York office. One of Giuliani\u2019s security firms employed a former head of the New York FBI office, and other alumni of it. It was agents of that office, probing Anthony Weiner\u2019s alleged sexting of a minor, who pressed Comey to authorize the review of possible Hillary Clinton-related emails on a Weiner device that led to the explosive letter the director wrote Congress. \r\nHours after Comey\u2019s letter about the renewed probe was leaked on Friday, Giuliani went on a radio show and attributed the director\u2019s surprise action to \u201cthe pressure of a group of FBI agents who don\u2019t look at it politically.\u201d \r\n\u2018The other rumor that I get is that there\u2019s a kind of revolution going on inside the FBI about the original conclusion [not to charge Clinton] being completely unjustified and almost a slap in the face to the FBI\u2019s integrity,\u201d said Giuliani. \u201cI know that from former agents. I know that even from a few active agents.'\u201d \r\nKey to understanding the problem is understanding the nature of the \u201cindependence\u201d of the FBI. Established at a time when organized crime ran rampant across the nation, the FBI, operating outside any constitutional authority and in direct contravention of constitutional law, grew from small number of unarmed legal consultants to a government within the government. \r\nWith the advent of World War II, the FBI grew to massive strength and began operating around the world. They were given broad powers to mete out justice, unlimited powers of search and arrest, of surveillance and even summary execution when they deemed in the national interest. \r\nWith the Cold War, the FBI rode the Red Menace scare to infinite power while partnering with organized crime. J. Edgar Hoover often denied that organized crime existed and was later to have been discovered a victim of blackmail at the hands of Meyer Lansky. From VT: \r\n\u201cNo provision was established within the constitution to regulate or oversee a national police force, it didn\u2019t take long for the FBI to become the Cheka within a short period after it\u2019s creation, J. Edgar Hoover, turned \u2018the bureau\u2019 into a monstrosity blackmailing politicians and cozying up to crime figures while Hoover\u2019s FBI chased \u2018commies\u2019 both real and imaginary, it protected not only the mafia but powerful international crime cartels as well, becoming the real \u2018Murder Inc.\u2019 Taxpayer financed strong-arm thugs supported by a disinformation campaign. \r\nHoover gained control of the press almost immediately, keeping files on his press enemies, threatening and blackmailing; some of this was to protect his own secrets \u2013 mob ties and his notorious penchant for sexual deviance, now long in the public domain, but it went further \u2013 it was all about power. \r\n\u2018Mary\u2019 Hoover liked to dress as a woman and was infamously covertly photographed along with his longtime companion and lover Clyde Tolson in flagrante delicto; those photographs came into the possession of mob kingpin Meyer Lansky, thus ensnaring Hoover, and by extension the entire FBI in a dangerous marriage with the mob. There is no evidence they ever got divorced, though from time to time the relationship may have been somewhat rocky.\u201d \r\nWith the Watergate scandals, the FBI made the case for being made \u201cunanswerable\u201d to executive authority, even the President or Attorney General. Instead, their only oversight is within the House of Representatives. \r\nHowever, with the Tea Party takeover of the House, financed by gambling boss Sheldon Adelson, and based on illegal reapportionment of the House districts, defended by a radicalized Supreme Court in continual 5/4 deadlock, the House got out of control, running continual investigations based on internet rumors and conspiracy theories. \r\nToo offset their zeal and insanity, a well run FBI might well have investigated the House itself, finding drug and gambling/human trafficking funds filling its coffers, opened and placed above the law by the 5/4 Citizens United Supreme Court ruling that legalized unlimited unaccounted offshore funds used to bribe officials. \r\nAccording to informants, this cabal, including FBI and Pentagon officials, has discussed assassinations of American leaders, military and intelligence support for terror groups and maintains strong ties, through Cuba, with the drug cartels of Mexico and Columbia. \r\nWhen the Oregon \u201cStandoff\u201d defendants were found \u201cnot guilty,\u201d it was the FBI that scuttled the case because it was the FBI, through informants that run the majority of the violent anti-government supremacist/anti-Semitic groups, that planned the takeover of Federal land at gunpoint. \r\nFrom a Spencer Ackerman article in the UK Guardian, November 3, 2016 \r\nOne agent called the bureau \u2018Trumplandia,\u2019 with some colleagues openly discussing voting for the Republican nominee. \r\nDeep antipathy to Hillary Clinton exists within the FBI, multiple bureau sources have told the Guardian, spurring a rapid series of leaks damaging to her campaign just days before the election. Current and former FBI officials, none of whom were willing or cleared to speak on the record, have described a chaotic internal climate that resulted from outrage over director James Comey\u2019s July public decision not to recommend indictment over Clinton\u2019s maintenance of a private email server on which classified information transited. \r\n\u201cThe FBI is Trumpland,\u201d said one current agent. \r\nThis atmosphere raises major questions about how Comey and the bureau he is slated to run for the next seven years can work with Clinton should she win the White House. \r\nThe currently serving FBI agent said Clinton is \u201cthe antichrist personified to a large swath of FBI personnel,\u201d and that \u201cthe reason why they\u2019re leaking is they\u2019re pro-Trump.\u201d \r\nThe agent called the bureau \u201cTrumplandia,\u201d with some colleagues openly discussing voting for a GOP nominee who has garnered unprecedented condemnation from the party\u2019s national-security wing and who has pledged to jail Clinton if elected. \r\nOn the other side is the Pentagon. The conspiracy theories and rumors are still flying about \u201cBarksdale/Minot.\u201d Back in 2006, a B52 took off from Minot Air Force Base with a full load of hydrogen bombs. They were \u201cillegally\u201d or \u201cimproperly\u201d authorized and were being flown out of the United States, we are told, to Diego Garcia. \r\nSince that time, hundreds of officers, including the entire American nuclear command, have been replaced. We have it on reliable authority, at the highest levels, that officers inside the Pentagon, many recruited into religious extremist organizations operating at the service academies, West Point, Annapolis and the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, had been channeled into positions of authority by a religious cult that sprung up in the early 1980s at the Presidio, a one time Army base in San Francisco, California. \r\nAmong the founders of that movement were General Paul Vallely, who along with Michael Aquino (rank unknown at this time), founded America\u2019s psychological warfare capability but also founded the Temple of Set, a Satanic cult that spread through the American military. Remember, it was the FBI that in 1992 declared that the ritual satanic killings of the 1970s and 80s including the alleged abuses on 15 military bases tied to the Temple of Set, were only \u201cconspiracy theories.\u201d \r\nIt is Vallely\u2019s group, Stand Up America, that has attracted so many pro-Trump FBI agents. This is one of the paths that tie the FBI to the Pentagon, through Montana\u2019s \u201cpatriot elites,\u201d many military and intelligence contractors, all right wing, many anti-government and all closet militia backers. \r\nBefore that, it was the FBI\u2019s SSAIC (Supervising Special Agent In Charge) from the FBI\u2019s massive Los Angeles office, Ted Gunderson, that the fight against ritual abuse and human trafficking that led to a series of quashed investigations that led into the highest levels of Washington. After his retirement,Gunderson went on a personal crusade against the FBI for covering up ritual child abuse. Gunderson was approached by a number of informants and volunteers, who turned out to be his undoing. Two came to live with him, Tim XXXX and Stew XXXX, who looted his files and turned them over to the FBI. \r\nThese individuals, who still work with the InfoWars organization run by Alex Jones, a Trump advisor and confidant, who also helped organize the Oregon Standoff. \r\nConclusion \r\nWe are told that we have at least 100 FBI agents who have submitted resignations if Hillary Clinton is not arrested. They claim, we are told by former Representative Tom Delay, they have extensive knowledge of her case and a coverup within the FBI. \r\nOnly a few short years ago, the same story of FBI resignations was based on another assertion, that the FBI was involved in a criminal coverup of President Obama\u2019s foreign birth. \r\nWhat we do know is this, the FBI is not just politicized. They are working hand in hand with obstructionists in congress, adding to the legislative abuses of separation of powers something far more sinister. The FBI is abusing the justice system as well, fabricating evidence, planting emails, intimidating witnesses, quashing investigations and openly involving themselves in the political process. \r\nThere is currently NO public confidence in the FBI, in its director and, similarly, there is no public confidence in rank and file agents as well. The barrel is all rotten apples, there is nothing else but. \r\nPresident Obama has cited the FBI for politically oriented leaks. We fear that Obama, who should be obligated to act, with do nothing out of fear of being accused of \u201cleadership.\u201d \r\nWe wonder what he has to lose.",

    "body_en": "How Hillary Clinton Poisoned American Politics Crazy conspiracy theories dominate the final days before Nov. 8 Share This \r\nFBI Director James Comey\u2019s decision to reopen the investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s mishandling of classified information has the Clintonites falling back on their tried-and-true response to all the revelations coming from WikiLeaks and other sources \u2013 it\u2019s all a Russian plot. Except, this time, the hysteria has reached such a fever pitch, and the conspiracy theories are so unhinged, that the political discourse in this country will be poisoned for years to come. \r\nIt started with Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio), who told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer: \r\n\u201cSo the question is: Where did these [emails] come from? How did they get to the FBI? Is Russia involved in this? We don\u2019t have a clue where this stuff is coming from.\u201d \r\nWe don\u2019t know if Ryan was drunk ( again ) when he said this, but his nickname of \u201c Congressman Moonbeam \u201d seems well-earned, and the implication of his remarks \u2013 that the FBI is in league with the Russians \u2013 underscores his marginality. However, it wasn\u2019t long before the marginal started merging with the mainstream. In tandem with Rya, Howard Dean, former presidential candidate and once head of the Democratic party, tweeted : \r\n\u201cIronically, Comey put himself on the same side as Putin.\u201d \r\nNow Dean may be a bit more credible than Ryan, but who can forget the \u201c Dean scream \u201d that dramatized his loonier side, and effectively knocked him out of contention for the Democratic presidential nomination? And then there were those payments from the Mujahideen-e-Khalq , a nutty Marxist-Islamist cult, in return for serving as their front man. And so while Dean may be better known, what he\u2019s know for isn\u2019t exactly adding to his credibility, and so we can safely relegate this kind of conspiracy theorizing to the fringes of the Democratic party spectrum. Right? \r\nWrong. Here is longtime Clintonite strategist James Carville opining that \u201cIt\u2019s unprecedented \u2026 the House Republicans and the KGB are trying to influence our democracy.\u201d Well, okay, who listens to Carville, anyway? He\u2019s so yester day! Well, then, get a load of Harry Reid, who leads the Senate\u2019s Democrats, repeating a different version of the same nonsense in a letter to Comey : \r\n\"In my communications with you and other top officials in the national security community, it has become clear that you possess explosive information about close ties and coordination between Donald Trump, his top advisors, and the Russian government \u2013 a foreign interest hostile to the united states, which Trump praises at every opportunity. The public has a right to know this information. I wrote to you months ago calling for this information to be released to the public. There is no danger to American interests from releasing it. And yet, you continue to resist calls to inform the public of this critical information.\" \r\nIt\u2019s so \u201cexplosive\u201d that it exploded into utter nothingness, according to the New York Times this [Tuesday] morning: \r\n\u201cFor much of the summer, the F.B.I. pursued a widening investigation into a Russian role in the American presidential campaign. Agents scrutinized advisers close to Donald J. Trump, looked for financial connections with Russian financial figures, searched for those involved in hacking the computers of Democrats, and even chased a lead \u2013 which they ultimately came to doubt \u2013 about a possible secret channel of email communication from the Trump Organization to a Russian bank. \r\n\u201cLaw enforcement officials say that none of the investigations so far have found any conclusive or direct link between Mr. Trump and the Russian government. And even the hacking into Democratic emails, FBI and intelligence officials now believe, was aimed at disrupting the presidential election rather than electing Mr. Trump.\u201d \r\nAs Gertrude Stein once put it, \u201cThere\u2019s no there there.\u201d She was talking about Oakland, California, but might just as well have been describing the inside of Harry\u2019s brain. \r\nAnd, yes, you read the above cited Times story right: instead of going after terrorists, or ordinary criminals, for months the FBI has been chasing down rabbit holes looking for Trump\u2019s alleged links to the nonexistent International Kremlin/Alt-Right/Putinist Conspiracy. We have returned to the halcyon days of J. Edgar Hoover, when people were investigated and harassed for their political views at the instigation of their ideological opponents. \r\nOh, but the FBI was too \u201c overburdened and undermanned \u201d to keep Omar Mateen on their radar. \r\nIn this election, the tragic and the comic mix and merge, but surely the former is dominant in the latest of Franklin Foer\u2019s Russophobic effusions. Formerly the editor of The New Republic , who was unceremoniously dumped by its new owner, Foer has teamed up with the Clinton campaign as its unofficial conspiracy theorist, spinning tales of Trump\u2019s \u201clinks\u201d to the Russians. He\u2019s the Alex Jones of the Clinton crowd, except that not even Jones would be caught dead promoting the kind of incoherent nonsense in Foer\u2019s latest screed . \r\nAccording to Foer, Trump has a \u201csecret server\u201d set up specifically to communicate with his Kremlin Masters. We know this because a \u201ccomputer scientist\u201d who wants to be known only as \u201cTea Leaves,\u201d and other \u201cexperts\u201d \u2013 who also don\u2019t want to tell us their names \u2013 have supposedly \u201cdiscovered\u201d this Secret Link. The server connects to the Alfa Bank, which is located in \u2013 cue in scary music \u2013 Russia! And guess what!? This closed communication link was especially active during politically sensitive times! This, according to Foer and his anonymous band of \u201cexperts,\u201d is conclusive proof that The Donald is a secret agent of the KGB, intent on polluting our precious bodily fluids with icky Russian cooties. \r\nThe only problem with this wacky conspiracy theory is that there\u2019s a prosaic explanation for the existence of this \u201csuspicious\u201d online traffic: the Trump Organization had hired a company to send out ads for their hotels. The online traffic to Alfa Bank meant only that several employees of that bank had stayed in Trump\u2019s hotels and were being solicited to do so again. And in spite of the \u201cscientific\u201d-looking chart displayed in the Foer piece, in fact the online traffic to and from Alfa didn\u2019t \u201cpeak\u201d when the US political scene got hot: \u201cThat\u2019s wrong,\u201d writes Timothy B. Lee in the anti-Trump pro-Hillary Vox.com. \u201cIf anything, the chart shows the opposite of that.\u201d \r\nAs Lee puts it: \r\n\u201c Foer claims that the pattern of traffic between the Trump Organization and Alfa Bank servers is highly unusual \u2013 so unusual that it can best be explained as a secretive communication link between Donald Trump and the Kremlin. \r\n\u201cBut in this case, there seems to be a plausible and perfectly innocent explanation for the traffic pattern suggested by an IT consultant named Naadir Jeewa and endorsed by security expert Robert Graham : The Trump organization is sending out promotional emails about Trump hotels, and one or more Alfa Bank employees is on the recipient list. \r\n\u201cThis is actually the explanation that\u2019s suggested by Occam\u2019s razor because \u2013 as Foer himself acknowledges in his story \u2013 the server was originally registered by an email marketing firm called Cendyn. The Trump organization seems to have hired Cendyn to send out emails promoting Trump\u2019s hotels, a service Cendyn has been providing since the Trump server was registered in 2009. So the most obvious explanation for the traffic is that Cendyn is using its server for its intended purpose.\u201d \r\nWhen Hillary Clinton\u2019s Twitter account tweeted Foer\u2019s farrago and declared \u201cIt\u2019s time for Trump to answer serious questions about his ties to Russia,\u201d cyber-security expert Robert Graham replied on his blog : \r\n\u201cThis is nonsense. The evidence available on the Internet is that Trump neither (directly) controls the domain \"trump-email.com,\" nor has access to the server. Instead, the domain was setup and controlled by Cendyn, a company that does marketing/promotions for hotels, including many of Trump\u2019s hotels. Cendyn outsources the email portions of its campaigns to a company called Listrak, which actually owns/operates the physical server in a data center in Philadelphia.\u201d \r\nSo the server wasn\u2019t even owned by the Trump Organization . And yet it took the FBI months, and \u201cjournalists,\u201d including even The Intercept , \u201cweeks\u201d to conclude that this story is completely bogus. The US taxpayers should demand their money back \u2013 not to mention Pierre Omidyar . \r\nEven after this sloppy McCarthyite smear was debunked, the Clinton campaign breathlessly repeated the charges: \u201cThis secret hotline may be the key to unlocking the mystery of Trump\u2019s ties to Russia\u201d! What this perfervid fantasy is the actually key to is the hysterical desperation of the Clinton campaign as it is engulfed in daily scandals that threaten to sink it beneath the electoral waves. \r\nAre you laughing \u2013 or crying \u2013 yet? Oh, but I\u2019m not done! If you think this grade-B conspiracy theory is the lowest form of electoral entertainment, then you obviously haven\u2019t read David Corn\u2019s latest entry into the Smear Trump Sweepstakes. Glenn Greenwald \u2013 no friend of Trump\u2019s \u2013 describes it as \u201can unnamed person, from an unknown country, who used to work in an unnamed agency, claims Trump is a Russian agent.\u201d How did the real estate mogul become a tool of the Kremlin? Well, you see, Trump once traveled to Russia, where he was suborned by one of those slinky-looking Russian ladies and \u201cRussian intelligence had \u2018compromised\u2019 Trump during his visits to Moscow and could \u2018blackmail him.\u2019\u201d \r\nYes, they\u2019re blackmailing Trump over a sexual indiscretion \u2013 because that would destroy him for sure ! And it\u2019s all in a \u201csecret memo\u201d that only Corn, the editors of Mother Jones , and their Mysterious Veteran Spook have seen. \r\nOn one level, this is hysterically funny; it\u2019s grade-C thriller material that is likely to be found at the bottom of some publisher\u2019s slush pile. On another level \u2013 the political level \u2013 it is immensely depressingly significant \u2013 because these people are \u201cliberals,\u201d even \u201cleftists.\u201d They aren\u2019t stupid: they know the ignominious history of witch-hunting in this country. I\u2019d call this McCarthyism \u2013 but even Joe McCarthy had some actual evidence to back up his claims of \u201cforeign agents\u201d lurking in the corridors of power. Corn, Foer, and the Clinton campaign are simply retailing lies. \r\nWhat\u2019s depressing about this is the fact that, if Hillary wins, it isn\u2019t going to stop. Far from it: the new \u201cred scare\u201d will accelerate, as her political enemies are tarred with the \u201cKGB agent\u201d brush. And when the notoriously vindictive Democratic candidate takes revenge not only on her domestic political enemies, but on the Russians, an ugly \u2013 and dangerous \u2013 confrontation is in the cards. She\u2019ll sic the FBI on Trump\u2019s supporters, and Trump himself, and she\u2019ll unleash the US military and our allies on Putin \u2013 and then, watch out. \r\nThat American liberalism has degenerated into a Russophobic, warmongering, witch-hunting ideology so quickly is one of the most astonishing ideological transformations in our political history. And all in the name of garnering partisan political advantage. As Donald Trump would put it: Sad! \r\nNOTES IN THE MARGIN \r\nYou can check out my Twitter feed by going here .
