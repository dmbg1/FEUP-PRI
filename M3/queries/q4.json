    "title_es": "\u00abNos empujan a la guerra\u00bb, por Willy Wimmer",
    "body_es": "Willy Wimmer, ex vicepresidente de la OSCE, aborda el tema sirio\r\n\u00abNos empujan a la guerra\u00bb por Willy Wimmer El mundo vive hoy los momentos m\u00e1s peligrosos de la historia posterior al fin de la guerra fr\u00eda. En entrevista concedida a Ilona Pfeffer para la agencia de prensa Sputnik, Willy Wimmer, ex secretario de Estado del ministerio de Defensa de Alemania, aborda la crisis siria y denuncia a los responsables de la grave situaci\u00f3n creada alrededor de ese conflicto.\r\nRed Voltaire | 31 de octubre de 2016 Sputnik : Se\u00f1or Wimmer, los combates en Siria no se detienen y los ceses de hostilidades pactados se violan constantemente. La implicaci\u00f3n de Estados Unidos y Rusia se comenta de forma sesgada en los medios de prensa occidentales. \u00bfC\u00f3mo ve usted la situaci\u00f3n en Siria?\r\nWilly Wimmer : Estamos ante una situaci\u00f3n que ven\u00eda incub\u00e1ndose desde hace tiempo y que tr\u00e1gicamente lleg\u00f3, hace 5 a\u00f1os, a transformarse en guerra civil y conflicto en el preciso momento en que cre\u00edamos haber resuelto la situaci\u00f3n conflictiva entre Siria e Israel vinculada a las alturas del Gol\u00e1n. Iba a concluirse un acuerdo que hubiera podido llevar paz a todo el Medio Oriente si no hubiese sido por la existencia de fuerzas desfavorables a un acuerdo de paz. Sabemos que, al inicio de la tragedia siria, fuerzas especiales del Reino Unido, Francia y Estados Unidos se hallaban en el terreno para crear esta situaci\u00f3n de guerra civil y darle una dimensi\u00f3n internacional.\r\nExist\u00edan por tanto antecedentes portadores de esperanza, si no se hubiese invertido ese movimiento. Desde entonces estamos asistiendo a una tragedia y el pueblo sirio parece exhausto. Ahora es importante poner fin a la tragedia y tratar de evitar por todos los medios que las chispas del enfrentamiento iniciado en Siria se extiendan a otros pa\u00edses, incluyendo los nuestros [en Occidente] porque eso significar\u00eda una gran guerra.\r\nEn ese contexto, quiero referirme \u2013con toda intenci\u00f3n\u2013 al informe presentado en Holanda sobre la destrucci\u00f3n del avi\u00f3n de pasajeros de Malasia. Tenemos que preguntarnos si existe realmente alg\u00fan inter\u00e9s en aclarar esa tragedia o si alguien est\u00e1 buscando un pretexto para desatar la guerra.\r\nEsa es la situaci\u00f3n que tenemos ante nosotros y es por eso que Siria no est\u00e1 muy lejos de ese tema. Tenemos que hacer todo lo posible por contribuir a una soluci\u00f3n pac\u00edfica y eso quiere decir no enviar armas, dinero ni tropas a la regi\u00f3n.\r\nSputnik : Rusia est\u00e1 en el terreno desde hace un a\u00f1o. \u00bfQu\u00e9 \u00e9xitos pueden verse? \u00bfQu\u00e9 papel est\u00e1n desempe\u00f1ando Estados Unidos y sus aliados?\r\nWilly Wimmer : La implicaci\u00f3n de Estados Unidos y de Europa occidental en Siria es una clara violaci\u00f3n del derecho internacional. Es una intervenci\u00f3n militar en territorio de otro Estado sin autorizaci\u00f3n de la ONU ni del derecho internacional. Son esas las fuerzas que han originado toda esta tragedia en Siria.\r\nLa \u00fanica posibilidad de poner fin al ba\u00f1o de sangre en Siria es la acci\u00f3n de la Federaci\u00f3n Rusa, que intervino a favor del derecho internacional a nivel global para que evitar que fuese pisoteado. Eso es lo que Estados Unidos ha venido demostrando desde la guerra desatada contra Yugoslavia, tambi\u00e9n en flagrante violaci\u00f3n del derecho internacional.\r\nSe trata, por una parte, del combate en Siria misma. Pero tambi\u00e9n se trata por otra parte, desde 1999, de saber si el intento de Estados Unidos de llevar adelante su ofensiva global va a prosperar o si el mundo tiene a\u00fan una posibilidad de restablecer la cooperaci\u00f3n pac\u00edfica entre los pueblos. Sin la implicaci\u00f3n rusa en Siria, del lado del gobierno leg\u00edtimo, el mundo ya no tendr\u00eda ninguna posibilidad.\r\nSputnik : En su opini\u00f3n, \u00bfcu\u00e1les son los objetivos de Estados Unidos en Siria?\r\nWilly Wimmer : Es evidente que Estados Unidos pretende redise\u00f1ar el mundo, al sur de Europa occidental y de la Federaci\u00f3n Rusa. Es por eso que estamos viendo toda una sucesi\u00f3n de conflictos y guerras que van desde Afganist\u00e1n, Irak y Siria hacia las costas del Mediterr\u00e1neo y Mali. Estados Unidos est\u00e1 implicado en todas esas regiones, donde libra guerras y contribuye a empeorar la miseria de sus pueblos y la destrucci\u00f3n de sus civilizaciones, lo cual sigue haciendo pese a todo.\r\nRusia entr\u00f3 en el conflicto sirio debido a su leg\u00edtima alianza con la Rep\u00fablica \u00c1rabe Siria y el presidente Bachar al-Assad, lo cual es totalmente conforme con el derecho internacional. En eso reside la gran diferencia entre Estados Unidos y la Federaci\u00f3n Rusa. Estados Unidos es responsable de sangrientos cr\u00edmenes en nuestro entorno y es igualmente responsable de buena parte de los flujos migratorios que actualmente enfrentamos. La Federaci\u00f3n Rusa se compromete a favor de un regreso a la negociaci\u00f3n y a la raz\u00f3n y a una cooperaci\u00f3n pac\u00edfica entre los pueblos.\r\nLa tragedia en Siria es que quien est\u00e1 pagando los platos rotos es el pueblo sirio y por eso es absolutamente necesario encontrar la manera de reinstaurar la paz. M\u00e1s all\u00e1 de las rupturas, quiz\u00e1s sea posible despertar el resto de sentido com\u00fan que a\u00fan pudiera quedar en Washington.\r\nEl problema con Estados Unidos es que en este momento, antes de la elecci\u00f3n presidencial, el mundo se halla en una situaci\u00f3n extremadamente peligrosa. Las fuerzas que realmente dominan la pol\u00edtica estadounidense quieren poder decidir todo lo que har\u00e1 el futuro gobierno de Estados Unidos. Eso quiere decir que lo m\u00e1s probable es la guerra: una guerra que ir\u00eda m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de Siria.\r\nSputnik : La cooperaci\u00f3n entre las dos grandes potencias funciona hasta ahora bastante mal, aunque Rusia expresa a menudo su deseo de cooperaci\u00f3n. \u00bfCu\u00e1les son las causas de estos fracasos y qu\u00e9 posibilidades ve usted para la cooperaci\u00f3n?\r\nWilly Wimmer : A pesar de la falta de transparencia, yo soy optimista en cuanto a la posibilidad de un entendimiento entre ambas partes, porque lo que est\u00e1 en juego es enorme y las consecuencias ser\u00edan mucho peores que las im\u00e1genes que actualmente nos llegan de Siria.\r\nY eso podr\u00eda afectarnos ma\u00f1ana, en una regi\u00f3n mucho m\u00e1s extensa, ya que los intentos de Rusia por impedir ese escenario y contener el conflicto no corresponden a los intereses de Estados Unidos. No es la administraci\u00f3n Obama quien define esos intereses sino las fuerzas que apuestan por la victoria de Hillary Clinton.\r\nEs un esquema bastante conocido. Dada la dram\u00e1tica envergadura del conflicto, s\u00f3lo puedo esperar que Washington acepte llegar a un acuerdo. Si eso no sucede, tendremos que vivir un desastre ampliamente superior al de Siria.\r\nSputnik : Las informaciones de los medios occidentales dan la impresi\u00f3n de que Rusia es el principal responsable de la destrucci\u00f3n y las v\u00edctimas civiles en Siria. \u00bfQu\u00e9 piensa usted de esa presentaci\u00f3n de los hechos?\r\nWilly Wimmer : En cuanto a esto, hay que establecer diferencias. Todo lo que tiene que ver con Rusia, corresponde a la misma Rusia dar respuesta y eso es lo que est\u00e1 haciendo.\r\nEn lo que me concierne, como consumidor de los medios occidentales, lo que me parece indignante es la falsificaci\u00f3n de los hechos que venimos viviendo desde hace a\u00f1os. Hubo una \u00e9poca en la que el pluralismo era parte integrante de nuestra cobertura medi\u00e1tica, pero eso ya no existe. Est\u00e1n empuj\u00e1ndonos a la guerra. Eso es lo que ha podido observarse nuevamente este a\u00f1o. Jamie Shea, el vocero de la OTAN que nos forz\u00f3 a desatar la guerra contra Yugoslavia en 1999, fue solemnemente homenajeado este a\u00f1o en Berl\u00edn por los servicios prestados. \u00a1Eso demuestra en qu\u00e9 estado se halla nuestro panorama medi\u00e1tico! La democracia en Europa est\u00e1 seriamente amenazada.\r\nSputnik : \u00bfQui\u00e9n defiende tales intereses y qu\u00e9 mensaje se quiere transmitir?\r\nWilly Wimmer : El mensaje es este: estamos tocando los tambores de guerra, y tambi\u00e9n lo hacemos en relaci\u00f3n con Rusia. Hace 2 a\u00f1os, en el momento del golpe de Estado de Maidan, en Kiev, evitamos por un pelo el conflicto con la Federaci\u00f3n Rusa. Ese es el objetivo de la pol\u00edtica estadounidense que observamos desde 1999 y es lo que puede acabar con nosotros.\r\nSputnik : Usted se ha referido a los intereses de Estados Unidos pero \u00bfcu\u00e1l es el papel de Alemania?\r\nWilly Wimmer : Helmut Kohl et Gerhard Schroder todav\u00eda manten\u00edan la fuerza de car\u00e1cter necesaria para hacer valer los interereses de Alemania en el seno de la OTAN, para no involucrarse en los conflictos armados.\r\nMire usted la situaci\u00f3n actual: nuestra ministra de Defensa viaja a Irak para anunciar all\u00ed una nueva implicaci\u00f3n militar de Alemania en ese pa\u00eds. Siento mucho tener que decir que Berl\u00edn no est\u00e1 a la altura de Bonn en lo que se refiere a salvaguardar los intereses de Alemania.\r\nWilly Wimmer Fuente\r\nSputnik",

Que ella propuso a Chlimper y Cuba lo confes\u00f3 el congresista fujimorista Miguel \u00c1ngel Torres Morales, al declarar sin ambages al peri\u00f3dico Per\u00fa 21, el 2 de noviembre del a\u00f1o en curso. \u00a1Keiko pidi\u00f3 ayer y tuvo efecto al d\u00eda siguiente, por una suerte de arte congresal de birlibirloque, manumitido, porque as\u00ed opera con eficacia y velocidad el fraude procesal (Art. 416, C\u00f3digo Penal) que ella sigilosamente puso en marcha!\r\nNo dijo Torres Morales si tal proposici\u00f3n de Keiko Fujimori fue oralmente, por escrito, por fax o tuit, ni ante qu\u00e9 autoridad u \u00f3rgano del Congreso lo hizo, aunque se sabe que fue puesta en conocimiento de la Junta de Portavoces del Congreso, que preside Luz Salgado, reci\u00e9n ese mismo d\u00eda, 2-11-2016, a las 4 de la tarde, y la mete\u00f3rica y espasm\u00f3dica elecci\u00f3n fue al d\u00eda siguiente, 3-11-2016, en horas de la ma\u00f1ana, en menos de 24 horas, sin debate alguno en el Pleno, sin que los congresistas votantes tengan entre manos el Curr\u00edculum Vitae, o siquiera algunos documentos, que permitieran apreciar o escudri\u00f1ar sobre si los candidatos propuestos ten\u00edan o no los requisitos que la Ley Org\u00e1nica del Banco Central de Reserva exige, como son \u201creconocida solvencia moral\u201d y una \u201camplia competencia y experiencia en econom\u00eda y finanzas\u201d, y que \u201cno representen a entidad o inter\u00e9s particular alguno\u201d. Obviamente, estos requisitos deben acreditarse con documentos, no deducirse, y no inferirse del aire, por tratarse de hechos macizos, sostenidos en el tiempo, tampoco supeditarse el voto a consignas partidarias, am\u00e9n de la subida trascendencia del elegido.\r\nPETITORIO\r\nQue, en estricta aplicaci\u00f3n del Art\u00edculo 40\u00b0 del C\u00f3digo Procesal Constitucional que permite interponer demanda de amparo, a \u201ccualquier persona\u201d, por violaciones a los \u201cderechos difusos que gocen de reconocimiento constitucional\u201d (como al aire, al agua, al medio ambiente, al patrimonio cultural e hist\u00f3rico, al leg\u00edtimo ejercicio de la funci\u00f3n p\u00fablica, a la institucionalidad con cabal asidero constitucional, legal y reglamentario, si acaso alguien los ha logrado contaminar o averiar), interpongo esta demanda de amparo por la afectaci\u00f3n o lesi\u00f3n, que agravia al Estado o a la sociedad en general, de los siguientes derechos constitucionales:\r\n1.- a contar con funcionarios p\u00fablicos elegidos leg\u00edtimamente; 2.- al voto congresal v\u00e1lido, con apego a Constituci\u00f3n Pol\u00edtica, Ley Org\u00e1nica del Banco Central de Reserva y al Reglamento del Congreso; y 3.- a la transparencia de los actos del Estado que garantice el acceso a la informaci\u00f3n p\u00fablica.\r\nEn consecuencia, solicito que, reponi\u00e9ndose las cosas al estado anterior a la violaci\u00f3n de los derechos denunciada, se declare la NULIDAD (dejar sin efecto) de la Resoluci\u00f3n Legislativa N\u00b0 008-2016-2017-CR, de 27-10-2016, publicada en El Peruano, el 28-10-2016 y del Procedimiento Especial Parlamentario que le sirve de antecedente, de la misma fecha, donde se \u00a1omiti\u00f3 adrede el debate! y se adopt\u00f3 \u00a1acuerdos, v\u00eda votaci\u00f3n ileg\u00edtima, sin previo debate!, que el Reglamento del Congreso exige (Art\u00edculo 64\u00b0), pasos procedimentales que son de obligatorio cumplimiento, por estar previstos en normas especiales, atinentes precisamente a la elecci\u00f3n de los miembros del Directorio del Banco Central de Reserva que le compete al Congreso, tal como lo prev\u00e9 el Art\u00edculo 86\u00b0 de nuestra Carta Pol\u00edtica.\r\nFUNDAMENTOS DE HECHO y JUR\u00cdDICOS\r\n1.- Derecho a contar con funcionarios p\u00fablicos elegidos leg\u00edtimamente\r\nEl Art\u00edculo 86\u00b0 de la Constituci\u00f3n Pol\u00edtica se ocupa expresamente de la elecci\u00f3n, por el Congreso, de tres (3) miembros del Directorio del Banco Central de Reserva. Por lo tanto, los ciudadanos tenemos el derecho que esta selecci\u00f3n o elecci\u00f3n sea minuciosa, ponderada, responsable y leg\u00edtima, contando con los elementos de juicio del caso. No se elige a ciegas, por consignas inal\u00e1mbricas, sin verle la cara al elegido, sin escucharlo y sin examinar qui\u00e9n es, como en realidad se hizo. \u00a1Se viol\u00f3, pues, con suma torpeza esta norma constitucional!\r\nComo quiera que la propia Constituci\u00f3n Pol\u00edtica no consigna otros ingredientes de tal elecci\u00f3n, ella misma se remite a que sea el Reglamento del Congreso el que la desarrolle. De eso se ocupa el Art\u00edculo 94\u00b0 de la misma Carta Pol\u00edtica, cuando establece: \u201cEl Congreso elabora y aprueba su Reglamento, que tiene fuerza de ley\u201d. Con este Reglamento el Congreso opera, act\u00faa o funciona y no a discreci\u00f3n de la presidenta, o pero a\u00fan de una persona particular como Keiko Fujimori.\r\nCon tal sentido y prop\u00f3sito el aludido y vigente Reglamento del Congreso trata expresamente de la elecci\u00f3n de esos tres directores, en un llamado \u201cprocedimiento parlamentario especial\u201d, el mismo que ha sido burlado, transgredido o violado, pese a su asidero constitucional y su indiscutido rango legal. Veamos lo que establece su Art\u00edculo 64\u00b0, inciso c, del \u201cprocedimiento especial\u201d, como uno de los 3 \u201cprocedimientos parlamentarios\u201d:\r\n\u201cLos procedimientos parlamentarios son el conjunto de actos sucesivos e integrados que se realizan para promover el debate y los acuerdos del Congreso destinados a producir leyes y resoluciones legislativas, actos de control pol\u00edtico y designaciones y nombramientos. Pueden ser:\r\na.- Procedimiento Legislativo; que comprende el debate y aprobaci\u00f3n de leyes ordinarias, leyes org\u00e1nicas, leyes autoritativas para ejercer la legislaci\u00f3n delegada, leyes presupuestales y financieras, leyes de demarcaci\u00f3n territorial, leyes de reforma de la Constituci\u00f3n Pol\u00edtica, del Reglamento del Congreso y de resoluciones legislativas. b.- Procedimientos del Control Pol\u00edtico; que comprende la investidura del Consejo de Ministros, la interpelaci\u00f3n a los Ministros, la invitaci\u00f3n a los Ministros para que informen, las preguntas a los Ministros, la solicitud de informaci\u00f3n a los Ministros y a la administraci\u00f3n en general, la censura y la extensi\u00f3n de confianza a los Ministros, la investigaci\u00f3n sobre cualquier asunto de inter\u00e9s p\u00fablico, la daci\u00f3n de cuenta y el antejuicio pol\u00edtico.\r\nc.- Procedimientos Especiales; que comprende la designaci\u00f3n del Contralor, la elecci\u00f3n del Defensor del Pueblo, de los miembros del Tribunal Constitucional y de 3 miembros del Directorio del Banco Central de Reserva, as\u00ed como la ratificaci\u00f3n del Presidente de dicho Banco y del Superintendente de Banca y Seguros\u201d. (Art\u00edculo modificado aprobado por el Pleno del Congreso de fecha 6 de marzo de 1998).\r\nEn consecuencia, el \u201cprocedimiento especial\u201d, donde resultaron elegidos los 03 directores en cuesti\u00f3n, vulner\u00f3 o viol\u00f3 lo que dispone la parte general e introductoria de este Art\u00edculo 64\u00b0 del Reglamento del Congreso, aplicable a aqu\u00e9l, respecto de todo \u201cprocedimiento parlamentario\u201d, que es definido como el \u201cconjunto de actos sucesivos e integrados que se realizan para promover el debate y los acuerdos del Congreso destinados a producir...resoluciones legislativas, actos de control pol\u00edtico y designaciones y nombramientos\u201d.\r\nLo real y apod\u00edctico fue que en aquella sesi\u00f3n donde se produjo la elecci\u00f3n \u00a1no hubo debate alguno!, por lo que no se examin\u00f3 nada que permita colegir que se eligieron o escogieron a quienes ten\u00edan una \u201creconocida solvencia moral\u201d o quiz\u00e1 \u201camplia competencia y experiencia en econom\u00eda y finanzas\u201d. \u00a1Todo fue un remedo!\r\nComo se podr\u00e1 f\u00e1cilmente advertir la elecci\u00f3n del jueves 27-10-2016 \u00a1no se hizo en un procedimiento especial reglamentario!, sino en uno trucado, \u00a1sin promover el debate!, y, adem\u00e1s, \u00a1sin adoptar los acuerdos como producto de dicho debate!\r\nPor lo tanto, no solo se transgredi\u00f3 el Art\u00edculo 86\u00b0 de la Constituci\u00f3n Pol\u00edtica, sino tambi\u00e9n la primera parte y adem\u00e1s el inciso c del Art\u00edculo 64 del Reglamento del Congreso, de expreso fundamento constitucional, con lo cual la ciudadan\u00eda peruana toda, de la que formo parte, result\u00f3 agraviada en su derecho a contar con funcionarios del Banco Central de Reserva constitucional, legal y reglamentariamente elegidos.\r\n\u00a1Por ende, los 3 ciudadanos que de este modo vedado resultaron electos: Jos\u00e9 Chlimper Ackerman, Rafael Rey Rey y Elmer Rafael Cuba Bustinza, frente a una proposici\u00f3n de Keiko Fujimori con fraude procesal, son ileg\u00edtimos!\r\n2.- Derecho al voto congresal v\u00e1lido, con apego a Constituci\u00f3n Pol\u00edtica, Ley Org\u00e1nica del Banco Central de Reserva y Reglamento del Congreso\r\nComo se sabe la elecci\u00f3n de los 3 miembros del Directorio del Banco Central de Reserva fue por 84 votos, la de Elmer Cuba; por 72, la de Jos\u00e9 Chlimper; y por 71, la de Rafael Rey. Ning\u00fan guarismo de esa votaci\u00f3n puede considerarse v\u00e1lido, leg\u00edtimo, porque ninguno de los votantes ten\u00eda la informaci\u00f3n documental que oficialmente se deber\u00eda haber presentado, distribuido a cada uno de los parlamentarios y examinada como fundamento de su voto. La propia misteriosa proposici\u00f3n de dos candidaturas por Keiko Fujimori sabemos que no apareja ning\u00fan documento de los candidatos, pese a que la Ley Org\u00e1nica del Banco Central de Reserva, en su Art\u00edculo 11\u00b0, exige como requisitos, de los que aspiren a ser miembros del Directorio del Banco, tener \u201creconocida solvencia moral\u201d y una \u201camplia competencia y experiencia en econom\u00eda y finanzas\u201d. Se trata de elementos reales, de hechos que deben probarse con documentos indubitables que el votante tiene que tener ante s\u00ed, para analizar, contrastar, evaluar y decidir su voto con apego a derecho, sin falsear su decisi\u00f3n a trav\u00e9s del voto no informado o por intereses vitandos que agreden al pa\u00eds. Reza el violado y desacatado, al votar inv\u00e1lidamente, Art\u00edculo 11\u00b0 de la citada Ley Org\u00e1nica: \u201c Los Directores deben ser peruanos, tener reconocida solvencia moral y poseer amplia competencia y experiencia en econom\u00eda y finanzas. No representan a entidad o inter\u00e9s particular alguno y su voto debe tener en cuenta \u00fanicamente el cumplimiento de la finalidad y las funciones del Banco\u201d. Si todos los congresistas votantes nunca vieron, dentro del llevado a cabo \u201cprocedimiento especial parlamentario\u201d, al que hemos antes glosado, ning\u00fan documento de los 3 propuestos, 2 por Keiko y otro dizque por el APRA, ni hubo debate alguno \u2013el cual se obvi\u00f3 adrede- respecto de sus calidades personales y profesionales, el voto que emitieron fue ciego, inducido por el mentado fraude, sin deliberaci\u00f3n mental alguna, al carecer de elementos de juicio objetivos reales sobre esa \u201creconocida solvencia moral\u201d, la necesaria \u201camplia competencia\u201d y adem\u00e1s la \u201camplia experiencia\u201d que deben favorecer a cada uno de los propuestos para un voto aprobatorio, v\u00e1lidamente emitido. \u00a1Si los hechos-requisitos y su prueba concomitante no est\u00e1n ante s\u00ed del congresista votante, su voto resulta viciado, por ende ileg\u00edtimo y nulo!\r\n3.- Derecho a la transparencia de los actos del Estado que garantice el acceso a la informaci\u00f3n p\u00fablica.\r\nTodo indica que nada en este procedimiento parlamentario de elecci\u00f3n de estos 3 directores del BCRP fue transparente; todo fue turbio, de principio a fin, con un clar\u00edsimo fraude procesal iniciado por la demandada Keiko Fujimori. Tanto la repentina proposici\u00f3n fraudulenta hecha por Keiko Fujimori, el d\u00eda 26-10-2016, un d\u00eda antes de la elecci\u00f3n, sin que se sepa hasta hoy c\u00f3mo fue, ante una Junta de Portavoces que no recibi\u00f3 ni vio los Curr\u00edculum Vitae de los propuestos; as\u00ed como la aluvional votaci\u00f3n llevada a cabo el d\u00eda siguiente, el jueves 27-10-2016, sin examinar ning\u00fan documento acerca de los requisitos que la ley exige a los candidatos y sin el debate que el Art\u00edculo 64\u00b0 del Reglamento del Congreso requiere para esta elecci\u00f3n espec\u00edfica, en un procedimiento parlamentario especial, en relaci\u00f3n a las calidades personales y profesionales, de los 3 futuros miembros del Directorio del Banco Central de Reserva, no reviste la obligatoria transparencia que deben adornar a los actos del Estado, como \u00e9ste del Congreso, que prev\u00e9 y regula la Ley 27806, o Ley de Transparencia, a fin de garantizar el derecho fundamental del acceso a la informaci\u00f3n que consagra el numeral 5 del Art\u00edculo 2 de la Constituci\u00f3n Pol\u00edtica.\r\nCuando los actos estatales realizados en todo el procedimiento especializado parlamentario en cuesti\u00f3n no son transparentes, como en efecto no lo han sido, el derecho fundamental a la informaci\u00f3n p\u00fablica resulta vulnerado, lo cual debe ser reparado.\r\n\u00bfFue la bravura de una brav\u00edsima KEIKO, su audacia o un inter\u00e9s nefando que la llev\u00f3 a proponer con fraude a miembros del BCRP? \u00a1Por lo menos, se sabe que fue Keiko Fujimori quien propuso, \u00bforalmente o por escrito?, a su secretario general de su partido pol\u00edtico, Jos\u00e9 Chlimper y a su ocasional asesor Elmer Cuba, como directores del BCRP, ambos activistas de su campa\u00f1a electoral presidencial \u00faltima, y ninguno de los 72 congresistas suyos chist\u00f3, rechist\u00f3, ni hizo amago de mueca alguna, todos doblegaron la cerviz y designaron, de un d\u00eda a otro, mediante su voto, a los propuestos, sin tr\u00e1mite ni debate alguno, ciegamente, sin examen de requisitos legales y sin tener a la vista a semejantes candidatos, ni siquiera o\u00edrlos porque ten\u00edan una premura inusitada!\r\n\u00bfTiene una persona particular, como Keiko Fujimori, lideresa de una agrupaci\u00f3n partidaria, el derecho de proponer, con efectos legales e inmediatos, en un procedimiento especial parlamentario, sin ser congresista, a directores del citado Banco, nada menos que al Secretario General de su partido Fuerza Popular y a otro activista de su reciente campa\u00f1a electoral presidencial?\r\n\u00bfSer\u00e1n los propuestos, de contundente actuaci\u00f3n pol\u00edtico partidaria, las personas independientes que contribuyan a la autonom\u00eda que requiere el BCRP sin poner en riesgo la confidencialidad de una sana pol\u00edtica bancaria y monetaria en particular?\r\n\u00a1Lo confiesa alegremente que ella fue la que propuso a estos 2 candidatos, su atento y comedido lugarteniente congresista Miguel Torres Morales, hijo de un antiguo fujimorista, ultramontano, Carlos Torres y Torres Lara, ya fallecido; pero que dej\u00f3 a su heredero universal en el Congreso y precisamente al lado o detr\u00e1s de Keiko. \u00a1Su padre estuvo detr\u00e1s de don Alberto, hoy preso!\r\nSi esta proposici\u00f3n fraudulenta, silenciosa y nada transparente fue suficiente para que 72 votaran por ella, significa que Keiko Fujimori \u00a1maneja a su antojo a los 72 congresistas de su partido Fuerza Popular, ora directamente o por interp\u00f3sita persona, como lo hac\u00eda antes Vladimiro Montesinos Torres (hoy tambi\u00e9n preso), en los a\u00f1os 90!\r\nAdem\u00e1s, la proposici\u00f3n y decisi\u00f3n adoptada viola el texto expreso del Art\u00edculo 11\u00b0 de la Ley Org\u00e1nica del Banco Central de Reserva del Per\u00fa.\r\nINCONSTITUCIONAL, ILEGALIDAD, DELITO y PRODUCTO ILEG\u00cdTIMO\r\nLa conducta es la pluralidad de actos realizados que exteriorizan una voluntad; y el producto es el resultado conseguido con esa conducta.\r\nLos congresistas, mayormente fujimoristas, que designaron a Jos\u00e9 Chlimper, Rafael Rey y Elmer Cuba, para integrar el directorio del Banco Central de Reserva del Per\u00fa (BCRP), violaron la Constituci\u00f3n Pol\u00edtica, las leyes Org\u00e1nica de dicho Banco, de Transparencia y el Reglamento del Congreso de la Rep\u00fablica, en la forma antes anotada.\r\nCuando tales parlamentarios producen actos administrativos, como es designar miembros del directorio del BCRP, o integrantes de otros organismos, est\u00e1n obligados a respetar las normas constitucionales y las legales de todo tipo y no zurrarse en ellas sin incurrir en responsabilidad. Su designio es respetar las normas preexistentes.\r\nLa Ley Org\u00e1nica del Banco Central de Reserva del Per\u00fa, en su art\u00edculo 11\u00b0, obliga que se designe como miembros del directorio del Banco a quienes tienen \"reconocida solvencia moral\" y adem\u00e1s \"amplia competencia y experiencia en econom\u00eda y finanzas\", requisitos que son hechos macizos, que deben ser reales y acreditados con los documentos respectivos. El congresista que vota por alguien propuesto no puede crear estos hechos en su cabeza, deducirlos de meros dichos o inferirlos por consigna partidaria. Viola la ley si desoye este mandato legal; comete, pues, una ilegalidad, una arbitrariedad.\r\nDel mismo modo, todo parlamentario debe \"velar por el respeto de la Constituci\u00f3n y de las leyes\", porque as\u00ed lo establece el Art\u00edculo 102\u00b0, inciso 2, de la Constituci\u00f3n Pol\u00edtica. Hasta podr\u00edamos aseverar que deben dar el ejemplo en acatar la Constituci\u00f3n y lo que dispone toda norma legal. Este precepto constitucional fue desacatado por todos aquellos congresistas que designaron con su voto a Chlimper, Rey y Cuba, como miembros del BCRP, sin que est\u00e9n acreditadas las situaciones de hecho que la citada Ley Org\u00e1nica ha previsto. Violaron, por ende, esa norma constitucional que les obliga a respetar las leyes en general y la del BCRP en particular. \u00a1Produjeron una infracci\u00f3n constitucional!\r\nEsta acci\u00f3n judicial (proceso de amparo) debe anular el ilegal acto administrativo que surgi\u00f3 sobre la base de dicha ilegalidad e inconstitucionalidad y el quehacer delictivo fraudulento antes rese\u00f1ado y hacer efectiva la responsabilidad de los infractores si no est\u00e1 cubierta por la inviolabilidad de votos y opiniones.\r\nEl delito de fraude procesal que se ha cometido est\u00e1 previsto en el Art\u00edculo 416\u00b0 del C\u00f3digo Penal, que sanciona el uso de cualquier medio fraudulento para obtener resoluci\u00f3n contraria a la ley. En efecto, se viol\u00f3 el Art\u00edculo 11\u00b0 de la Ley Org\u00e1nica del Banco Central de Reserva, sin que se conozcan si los propuestos por Keiko reun\u00edan los requisitos exigidos.\r\nMEDIOS PROBATORIOS\r\nOfrezco como medio de prueba puntual, lo siguiente:\r\na.- Copia de la Resoluci\u00f3n Legislativa N\u00b0 008-2016-2017-CR; b.- Copia de la nota period\u00edstica de Per\u00fa 21, del 2 de noviembre del 2016. c.- 3 copias de la relaci\u00f3n de congresistas demandados que votaron aquel 27-10-2016.\r\nANEXOS\r\na.- Copia del DNI del demandante, Anexo 1; b.- Copia de la Resoluci\u00f3n Legislativa, Anexo 2; c.- Copia del peri\u00f3dico Per\u00fa 21 del 2-11-2016, Anexo 3; d.- 3 copias de la relaci\u00f3n de los congresistas demandados y que votaron aquel 27-10-2016.\r\nPOR TANTO:\r\nSolicito, a vuestro juzgado constitucional, admitir la presente Demanda de Amparo contra Luz Salgado Rubianes, Presidenta del Congreso, Keiko Sof\u00eda Fujimori Higuchi y otros m\u00e1s, tramitarla conforme a ley y declararla FUNDADA, en su oportunidad.\r\nOTROS\u00cd DIGO.- Pido al juzgado que se sirva requerir oficialmente la relaci\u00f3n de los congresistas que votaron por la elecci\u00f3n de los se\u00f1ores Jos\u00e9 Chlimper Ackerman, Rafael Rey Rey y Elmer Rafael Cuba Bustinza, a quienes tambi\u00e9n los estoy demandando y el juzgado los considerar\u00e1 como tales, al haber cumplido sumisamente con el sentido de la proposici\u00f3n fraudulenta que les formul\u00f3 su codemandada Keiko Sof\u00eda Fujimori Higuchi.\r\nLo hago de este modo ya que en la web del Congreso no aparece esta relaci\u00f3n de los congresistas que votaron del modo cuestionado.

The HRC has endorsed Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election.\r\nTheir new video advertisement features Clinton\u2019s pledge to fight for the LGBT community\u2019s equality. The ad was also released days before the election on Nov. 8.\r\nThe video titled \u201cHillary Clinton: Equality Is About Changing Hearts And Minds,\u201d was released in Washington D.C., which is the HRC headquarters are located.\r\nThe organization has a section of their website dedicated to the group\u2019s endorsement of the candidate. The HRC also stated that Clinton has stood with the LGBTQ community and the group will now stand with Clinton. The HRC concluded by saying that Clinton\u2019s fight is with the community and that what the HRC advocates.\r\nThe HRC President Chad Griffin said that Clinton has shown through her words and actions that she is dedicated to fighting for the rights of the LGBT community. He also stated that all of the progress the community has made is at stake in the 2016 Presidential election as the HRC has endorsed a candidate in the 2016 election.\r\nGriffin then continued to state that Donald Trump\u2019s campaign is filled with hateful language that will reverse the LGBTQ movement\u2019s gains. He also said that Clinton will tear down the walls of bigotry against people of alternative lifestyles. The HRC leader concluded by saying that it is very important that people who are pro-equality voters for Clinton in the next presidential election.\r\nBreitbart stated that an artist from the Art Wing Conspiracy group said a lot of Trump supporters, especially amongst the LGBT community, are \u201cin the closet.\u201d The artistic group has painted several Think Different posters across the city of San Francisco near the offices of Twitter and Clinton\u2019s campaign headquarters. The posters feature a rainbow Apple logo with a silhouette of Trump\u2019s face on it. They were released on National Coming Out Day.\r\nThe Art Wing Conspiracy artist also stated that on National Coming Out Day the organization encourages people to \u201cstop living a lie and come out.\u201d He conveyed this idea, in a voting booth, i.e. a closet, no one has to know who supports Trump or Clinton.\r\nThe artist also said that the liberal community in San Francisco must know that there are many Trump supporters amongst the city\u2019s LGBT community. The individual stated that having pride means to be true to oneself and one\u2019s beliefs, even if it is against the mainstream. The artist concluded that is what the LGBT rights movement conveys.\r\nThe Stonewall Inn\u2019s website stated that the historic inn was the birthplace of the historic LGBT rights movement. The patrons of the club retaliated against harassment from the local police department. Subsequently, a riot occurred on June 28, 1969.\r\nThe website also claimed that the patrons refused to accept the status quo of oppression for the first time. They then stood up for each other and the whole LGBT community.\r\nThe site continues to state that the riot at the Stonewall Inn sparked the lengthy battle for all members of the Gay and Lesbian community. The incident is often referred to as the Rosa Parks incident of the LGBT community. The site then stated that the incident led the government and society, in general, to look at members of the LBGT community as equals.\r\nIn 1969 the police raided gay clubs regularly. Eight police officers arrived at the Stonewall Inn on a Saturday morning at 1:20. Approximately 200 people were in the establishment that night. However, the raid was not conducted as planned. The patrons did not cooperate, resulting in the riot that led to the LGBT rights movement of the 1970s, which is why the HRC now exists and has endorsed a candidate for the 2016 election.\r\nBy John A.

    "body_en": "Leave a reply \r\nPaul Craig Roberts \u2013 The election was set up to be stolen from Trump. That was the purpose of the polls rigged by overweighting Hillary supporters in the samples. After weeks of hearing poll results that Hillary was in the lead, the public would discount a theft claim. Electronic voting makes elections easy to steal, and I have posted explanations by election fraud experts of how it is done. \r\nClearly the Oligarchy does not want Donald Trump in the White House as they are unsure that they could control him, and Hillary is their agent. \r\nWith the reopening of the FBI investigation of Hillary and related scandals exploding all around her, election theft is not only more risky but also less likely to serve the Oligarchy\u2019s own interests. \r\nImage as well as money is part of Oligarchic power. The image of America takes a big hit if the American people elect a president who is currently under felony investigation. \r\nMoreover, a President Hillary would be under investigation for years. With so much spotlight on her, she would not be able to serve the Oligarchy\u2019s interests. She would be worthless to them, and, indeed, investigations that unearthed various connections between Hillary and oligarchs could damage the oligarchs. \r\nIn other words, for the Oligarchy Hillary has moved from an asset to a liability. \r\nA Hillary presidency could put our country into chaos. I doubt the oligarchs are sufficiently stupid to think that once she is sworn in, Hillary can fire FBI Director Comey and shut down the investigation. The last president that tried that was Richard Nixon, and look where that got him. \r\nMoreover, the Republicans in the House and Senate would not stand for it. House Committee on oversight and Government Reform chairman Jason Chaffetz has already declared Hillary to be \u201ca target-rich environment. Even before we get to day one, we\u2019ve got two years worth of material already lined up.\u201d House Speaker Paul Ryan said investigation will follow the evidence. \r\nIf you were an oligarch, would you want your agent under this kind of scrutiny? If you were Hillary, would you want to be under this kind of pressure? \r\nWhat happens if the FBI recommends the indictment of the president? Even insouciant Americans would see the cover-up if the attorney general refused to prosecute the case. Americans would lose all confidence in the government. Chaos would rule. Chaos can be revolutionary, and that is not good for oligarchs. \r\nMoreover, if reports can be believed, salacious scandals appear to be waiting their time on stage. For example, last May Fox News reported: \r\n\u201cFormer President Bill Clinton was a much more frequent flyer on a registered sex offender\u2019s infamous jet than previously reported, with flight logs showing the former president taking at least 26 trips aboard the \u201cLolita Express\u201d \u2014 even apparently ditching his Secret Service detail for at least five of the flights, according to records obtained by FoxNews.com. \u201cClinton\u2019s presence aboard Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s Boeing 727 on 11 occasions has been reported, but flight logs show the number is more than double that, and trips between 2001 and 2003 included extended junkets around the world with Epstein and fellow passengers identified on manifests by their initials or first names, including \u201cTatiana.\u201d The tricked-out jet earned its Nabakov-inspired nickname because it was reportedly outfitted with a bed where passengers had group sex with young girls.\u201d \r\nFox News reports that Epstein served time in prison for \u201csolicitation and procurement of minors for prostitution. He allegedly had a team of traffickers who procured girls as young as 12 to service his friends on \u2018Orgy Island,\u2019 an estate on Epstein\u2019s 72-acre island, called Little St. James, in the U.S. Virgin Islands.\u201d http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/05/13/flight-logs-show-bill-clinton-flew-on-sex-offenders-jet-much-more-than-previously-known.html \r\nSome Internet sites, the credibility of which is unknown to me, have linked Hillary to these flights. http://truepundit.com/breaking-bombshell-nypd-blows-whistle-on-new-hillary-emails-money-laundering-sex-crimes-with-children-child-exploitation-pay-to-play-perjury/ \r\nThis kind of behavior seems reckless even for Bill and Hillary, who are accustomed to getting away with everything. Nevertheless, if you are an oligarch already worried about the reopened Hillary email case and additional FBI investigations, such as the one into the Clinton Foundation, and concerned about what else might emerge from the 650,000 emails on former US Rep. Weiner\u2019s computer and the NYPD pedophile investigation, putting Hillary in the Oval Office doesn\u2019t look like a good decision. \r\nAt this point, I would think that the Oligarchy would prefer to steal the election for Trump, instead of from him, rather than allow insouciant Americans to destroy America\u2019s reputation by choosing a person under felony investigations for president of the United States. \r\nBeing the \u201cexceptional nation\u201d takes on new meaning when there is a criminal at the helm.

    "body_en": "at 11:29 am 2 Comments \r\nElection 2016 has been extremely bittersweet for me. On the positive side, through both the Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump grassroots movements, we have seen clear proof that a huge number of Americans accurately understand that the current system is totally rigged and simply not working for them. These people didn\u2019t migrate toward these two candidates for some tweaks to the system here and there, their supporters want full scale paradigm level change. \r\nAs such, rather than dwelling on the differences between these two populist movements, let\u2019s consider some of the areas where they overlap. \r\n1. Trade \u2014 Opposition to NAFTA and current \u201ctrade\u201d deals such as TPP, TTIP, and TISA have been central to both the Sanders and Trump campaigns. \r\n2. War and militarism \u2014 Whether you believe Trump is sincere or not, opposition to Obama/Clinton interventionist overseas wars were key talking points for both Trump and Sanders. \r\n3. The system is rigged \u2014 The painful acknowledgment that the U.S. economic system is a rigged scam that fails to reward hard work, and is more akin to a parasitic, predatory oligarchy with very limited social mobility, has been a key campaign theme for both Trump and Sanders. The economy is increasingly dominated by near-monoploy giants who relentlessly push for more power and more profits irrespective of the cost to society, whether that cost be war, poverty or social unrest. \r\n4. Money in politics \u2014 The rigged economic system described above aggregates wealth into an increasingly small number of hands. Those hands then buy off politicians and rig the political process. A rigged economy and rigged political system perpetually feeds itself and endlessly grows at the expense of the public like a terminal cancer. Both Trump and Sanders emphasized this problem. \r\n5. Rule of law is dead \u2014 Sanders focused on Wall Street bankers, while Trump focused on Hillary and her inner circle of cronies, but the overall point is the same. Rich and powerful oligarchs are above the law. We all know this, but Washington D.C. refuses to do anything about. \r\nDespite all of the above, the ultimate status quo candidate, Hillary Clinton, has a very good chance of winning tomorrow\u2019s election. Why? Primarily because Donald Trump is a very divisive figure who focused too much on polarizing issues such as building a wall, stop-and-frisk, supporting torture, advocating for internet censorship and libel laws, etc. While he got his act together toward the end of the campaign, he spent far too much of it marginalizing people like me who desperately want to vanquish the status quo, but couldn\u2019t get comfortable with Trump. \r\nThis is where the election took on a decidedly negative tone for me on a personal basis. I\u2019ve dedicated the last six years of my life to fully exposing and combating status quo corruption, but when the populist revolt finally arrived, the only choice I was given for change was one I couldn\u2019t embrace. For someone so passionately yearning for positive, paradigm-level change, that\u2019s been a crushing letdown. Personally, I\u2019ve passed the point where I\u2019m willing to vote for someone I don\u2019t believe in or trust. As such, I won\u2019t be voting for either one. That said, my individual vote is irrelevant, and I don\u2019t want to focus on that. The bigger question is, who do I think will win? \r\nOn that question, I don\u2019t have a strong opinion at the moment. Ultimately, it depends on whether Americans go into the voting booth and see status quo vs. blowing up the status quo, or if they see Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton. If they see the former, odds are in Trump\u2019s favor. If they see the latter, it\u2019s a matter of which personality Americans find least repulsive. \r\nSo here we stand. Despite the fact that a huge percentage of Americans deem both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton to be \u201cunelectable,\u201d one of them is about to be elected. As such, we really need to start thinking and strategizing about the future. In that regard, I propose we look at the five points of Sanders/Trump overlap I highlighted earlier. If we can stay focused on those existential issues after the election irrespective of who wins, \u201cwe the people\u201d have a good chance of uniting a clear majority of the population and ultimately turning this national disaster around. \r\nOr we can allow ourselves to be divided and conquered into oblivion. The choice is ours. \r\nIn Liberty,",

In a prominently featured NYT op-ed , Law Professor Richard Painter said \u201c(w)e cannot allow FBI or Justice Department officials to unnecessarily publicize pending investigations concerning candidates of either party while an election is underway. That is an abuse of power.\u201d .. Not according to former federal prosecutor Daniel Richman, saying \u201cComey\u2019s critics cannot show his letter violated the Hatch Act unless they can prove that the FBI director was intending to influence the election rather than inform Congress, which was (his) stated aim.\u201d .. A Sunday released ABC News/Washington Post poll indicated about a third of likely voters are less likely to support Hillary following Comey\u2019s October surprise. .. The Washington Post said the Justice Department\u2019s public integrity unit blocked the FBI from investigating the Clinton Foundation, claiming inadequate \u201cevidence to move forward.\u201d The department is run by longtime Bill and Hillary ally, Attorney General Loretta Lynch. Last June, she met privately with the former president at Phoenix\u2019s Sky Harbor airport while Hillary was under FBI investigation \u2013 a clear conflict of interest despite her disingenuously claiming \u201cno discussion of any matter pending for the department or any matter pending for any other body\u201d took place. .. In a Washington Post op-ed , former attorney general Eric Holder expressed concern about Comey\u2019s \u201cvague letter to Congress about emails potentially connected to a matter of public, and political, interest\u201d \u2013 claiming he \u201cviolated long-standing Justice Department policies and tradition.\u201d ..

Clearly, Comey\u2019s bombshell changed the dynamic of the race, whether enough to derail her White House bid we\u2019ll know in days. Reports indicate the FBI will examine an astonishing 650,000 emails from former Congressman Anthony Weiner\u2019s laptop \u2013 estranged husband of top Hillary aide Huma Abedin. .. \r\nIt could take months to review volume this immense, likely extending well beyond November 8 and January\u2019s inauguration, to determine if any evidence warrants prosecuting Hillary, Abedin, Weiner or anyone else for mishandling classified government documents, perhaps compromising national security. \r\n2. INTELLECTUAL LAZINESS & SELF-INFLICTED POLITICAL IDIOCY \r\nHarvard Undergrads for Hillary \r\nOVERWHELMING SYSTEMIC PROPAGANDA ALLIED WITH A PERVASIVE INTELLECTUAL LAZINESS CONSPIRE TO KEEP MINDS THAT SHOULD KNOW BETTER FROM SEEING THE MOST ELEMENTARY TRUTHS. BEING OFFICIALLY \u201cSMART\u201d IS NO VACCINE AGAINST THE BRAINWASH. A ccording to the student newspaper Harvard Crimson\u2019s October survey , 87% of undergrads support Hillary. A scant 6% back Trump, 5.8% for Libertarian Gary (\u201cwhat\u2019s Aleppo\u201d) Johnson, and less than 1% for Harvard College and Medical School graduate Jill Stein \u2013 the only people\u2019s candidate running. .. Around one-third of undergrads responded (2,128 out of a total 6,645 student body) \u2013 so the views of nonrespondents aren\u2019t known. About 91% are eligible to vote in November. Eligibility begins at age 18. A surprising 96% of respondents intend voting, they said. .. The national average is far lower. Whether this year\u2019s contentious election encourages a larger than usual turnout remains to be seen. The Crimson poll was conducted from October 10 \u2013 20 \u2013 before FBI Director Comey\u2019s October surprise. Whether it would have changed the results is unknown. Two-thirds of respondents said they support Democrat party candidates, 12% calling themselves Republicans, 19% saying they\u2019re independents. .. Trump and Hillary are the most widely reviled presidential aspirants in US history. Yet 70% of Crimson respondents view her favorably \u2013 showing little knowledge of her deplorable public record since the 1990s unless they support her war crimes, racketeering and perjury. What to make of it? Undergrads enter Harvard (and other colleges) as teenagers, young and naive as I was when entering the college long ago. .. After graduation, I discovered the meaning of the term \u201ccommencement.\u201d Institutions like Harvard teach students to be good citizens, omitting the ugly stuff about US imperialism, officials advancing it, waging endless wars of aggression. .. The so-called Korean War was ongoing when I was there, an incentive to maintain good grades, stay in school, avoid being drafted and sent to North Korea\u2019s frozen Chosin, an expression used by members of my class. .. The Paper Chase Hollywood film (1973) featured John Houseman as stern Harvard Law School Professor Charles Kingsfield. His most memorable line on day one for first year students was saying \u201c(y)ou teach yourselves the law, but I train your minds. You come here with a skull full of mush. You leave thinking like a lawyer.\u201d .. I began my freshman year \u201cwith a skull full of mush,\u201d gradually extracting it. College and graduate school taught me to think. Learning and comprehension mostly came later. The older I get, the greater my understanding of world and national issues. .. I\u2019m long removed from campus life. Back then, students had none of the advantages available today \u2013 no computers, no Internet. Daily writing I dearly love now was a dreaded chore back then \u2013 requiring research by rolodex cards and library stacks, a time-consuming process. Except for the type primary research I did for my master\u2019s thesis, most everything needed today for compositions or articles like mine is available on our desktops. .. It\u2019s understandable why young minds haven\u2019t achieved the wisdom of the ages. Still it\u2019s disturbing to find Harvard undergrads uninformed and out-of-touch on Hillary\u2019s deplorable public record \u2013 when it\u2019s so easy to research it and know what she and husband Bill are all about. .. Why hasn\u2019t the Harvard student body done its homework for perhaps the most important election in our lifetime. The stakes are huge \u2013 possible war on Russia with Hillary empowered or improved bilateral relations under Trump. Nothing matters more than saving humanity from the scourge of catastrophic thermonuclear war able to kill us all.

    "body_en": "U.S. militia girds for trouble as presidential election nears 11/02/2016 \r\nREUTERS \r\nDown a Georgia country road, camouflaged members of the Three Percent Security Force have mobilized for rifle practice, hand-to-hand combat training \u2014 and an impromptu campaign rally for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. \r\n\u201cHow many people are voting for Trump? Ooh-rah!\u201d asks Chris Hill, a paralegal who goes by the code name \u201cBloodagent.\u201d \r\n\u201cOoh-rah!\u201d shout a dozen militia members in response, as morning sunlight sifted through the trees last weekend. \r\nAs the most divisive presidential election in recent memory nears its conclusion, some armed militia groups are preparing for the possibility of a stolen election on Nov. 8 and civil unrest in the days following a victory by Democrat Hillary Clinton. \r\nThey say they won\u2019t fire the first shot, but they\u2019re not planning to leave their guns at home, either. \r\nTrump\u2019s populist campaign has energized militia members like Hill, who admire the Republican mogul\u2019s promise to deport illegal immigrants, stop Muslims from entering the country and build a wall along the Mexico border. Trump has repeatedly warned that the election may be \u201crigged,\u201d and has said he may not respect the results if he does not win. At least one paramilitary group, the Oath Keepers, has called on members to monitor voting sites for signs of fraud. \r\nArmed paramilitary groups first gained prominence in the early 1990s, fueled by confrontations in Ruby Ridge, Idaho and Waco, Texas, culminating in a militia sympathizer\u2019s 1995 bombing of a federal office building in Oklahoma City that killed 168 people. \r\nTheir numbers dwindled following that attack but have spiked in recent years, driven by fears that President Barack Obama will threaten gun ownership and erode the power of local government. The Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks extremist groups, estimates there were 276 active militias last year, up from 42 in 2008. \r\nIn recent years, armed groups have confronted federal authorities in a series of land-use disputes in the western United States. Federal officials fear more clashes could come after seven militants were acquitted on conspiracy charges for occupying a federal wildlife refuge in Oregon. \r\nMany fear Clinton would push the county further to the left. \r\n\u201cThis is the last chance to save America from ruin,\u201d Hill said. \u201cI\u2019m surprised I was able to survive or suffer through eight years of Obama without literally going insane, but Hillary is going to be more of the same.\u201d \r\n\r\nEXTREMIST GROUPS EMBOLDENED \r\nThe Oath Keepers, a prominent anti-government force that sent gun-toting members to the 2014 race riots in Ferguson, Missouri, called on members last week to monitor voting sites on election day for any signs of fraud. \r\nAn hour south of Atlanta, the Three Percent Security Force started the day around the campfire, taking turns shooting automatic pistols and rifles at a makeshift target range. They whooped with approval when blasts from one member\u2019s high-powered rifle knocked down a tree. \r\nThe group operates independently, but is affiliated with a national armed movement that calls for members to defend individual rights in the face of what they see as an overreaching federal government. The movement draws its name from the notion that no more than 3 percent of the American population fought in the Revolutionary War against Britain. \r\nAmid the war games, Hill weighed plans for a possible armed march on Washington if Clinton wins. \r\nHe said he doesn\u2019t want his members leading the way, but they will defend the protesters if need be. His group will not hesitate to act if a President Clinton tries to disarm gun owners, he said. \r\n\u201cI will be there to render assistance to my fellow countrymen, and prevent them from being disarmed, and I will fight and I will kill and I may die in the process,\u201d said Hill, who founded the militia several years ago. \r\nTrump\u2019s candidacy has emboldened extremist groups to speak more openly about challenging the rule of law, said Ryan Lenz, a researcher at the Southern Poverty Law Center. \r\n\u201cPrior to this campaign season, these ideas were relegated to sort of the political fringe of the American political landscape,\u201d he said. \u201cNow these ideas are legitimized.\u201d \r\nOver the past week, some prominent Trump supporters have hinted at violence. \r\n\u201cIf Trump loses, I\u2019m grabbing my musket,\u201d former Illinois Representative Joe Walsh wrote on Twitter last week. Conservative commentator Wayne Root fantasized about Clinton\u2019s death while speaking at a Trump rally in Las Vegas on Sunday. \r\nBack in Georgia, the Three Percent Security Force wrapped up rifle practice in the midday sun. They then headed further into the trees to tackle an obstacle course with loaded pistols at their sides, ready for whatever may come. \r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve building up for this, just like the Marines,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are going to really train harder and try to increase our operational capabilities in the event that this is the day that we hoped would never come.\u201d Share On:",

Print Email http://humansarefree.com/2016/11/biggest-winners-and-losers-of-2016-us.html The biggest collective losers of the campaign were the mainstream media. Some of course were worse than others, but all of the old fashioned mainstream outlets were terrible. They operated on a basis of contempt for the honest concerns of ordinary people.They hid Hillary Clinton\u2019s scandals from public view as though oblivious to the fact that in the internet age, the truth cannot be hidden nor suppressed by the failing media-industrial complex.Long before Donald Trump declared his candidacy, the systematic problems of mainstream media in the west were well known.The total deceit with which they cover international affairs, slandering countries which do not actively pursue neoliberal policies, was in full view. Their job is to report the facts and collect information. Instead they have acted like mad agitators for their pet geopolitical projects.As the mainstream media begins to collapse, so too are common misconceptions about war and peace. In 2003 when mainstream media still had a fairly stern grip on public consciousness, many were duped into believing Bush and Blair\u2019s lies about Iraq. Thanks to new media, people in the west have a far better understanding of the realities in the Middle East than they did thirteen years ago. It explains why popular support for war in Syria and by extrapolation on Russia, something that the likes of Hillary Clinton have wildly campaigned for, remains deeply unpopular with ordinary people. The Biggest Winner After Donald Trump , the biggest winners were Julian Assange and Wikileaks . Wikileaks did what honest journalists ought to do, they publish information that is vital to the public interest without having a hidden agenda. Assange expressed his personal disdain for both Trump and Clinton and recently explained the scientific reasons why Wikileaks released damning information on Clinton and not Trump. In all he said he was fair minded and open minded.This remained the case despite Hillary and her supporters making death threats to Assange and Assange having his internet connection at the Ecuadorian Embassy in which he remains captive, cut off after the US State Department put pressure on the Government of Ecuador. But Assange persisted and leak after leak showed American voters and the wider world who Hillary Clinton actually is. It is a very different image from the sugar coated picture painted by the mainstream media. [Her allegiance to the Rothschilds and NWO master manipulator George Soros has also been confirmed , as well as her strong ties to Monsanto .]Wikileaks exposed how Hillary says one thing in public and other to her friends in Wall Street. Wikileaks exposed lie after lie, cover-up after cover-up. Julian Assange\u2019s place in history as someone who has exposed the lies of politicians like Hillary Clinton is now assured. He is owed a debt of gratitude by all those who value truth and justice. By Adam Garrie (excerpt) Dear Friends, HumansAreFree is and will always be free to access and use.

Print Email http://humansarefree.com/2016/11/actually-nobody-won-2016-presidential.html \u201cNobody for President, that\u2019s my campaign slogan,\u201d Nick Cannon asserted in \u201c Too Broke to Vote ,\u201d his viral criticism of the American electoral process from March of this year. Now, it turns out nobody for president won the 2016 election in a landslide.According to new voter turnout statistics from the 2016 election, 47 percent of Americans voted for nobody, far outweighing the votes cast for Trump (25.5 percent) and Hillary (25.6 percent) by eligible voters.And the \u201cI voted for nobody\u201d group is actually much larger than the 47 percent reported because that number only includes eligible voters.How many millions of Americans under the legal voting age \u2014 not to mention the countless millions who have lost their voting rights \u2014 voted for nobody, as well? Factoring in those individuals, around 193 million people did not vote for Trump or Clinton. That\u2019s nearly two-thirds of the population of the United States.Nobody also seemingly won the presidential primaries, with only 9 percent of Americans casting their votes for either Trump or Clinton. So when does nobody take office? Nobody won the majority of votes in the primaries or the general election, and the two main candidates who were running didn\u2019t \u201cwin\u201d the popular vote \u2014 they simply slightly outcompeted each other considering neither garnered over 50 percent of the eligible voters\u2019 ballots.That\u2019s where the real debate begins.As I wrote back in August when the primary voter turnout rates came in, one could argue that Trump (and Obama ) do not have a legitimate mandate to rule over the people of the United States. Trump did not win the majority of Americans\u2019 votes \u2014 not even close. When all Americans are included, Trump only garnered the votes of about 19 percent of us. This means the United States will be ruled over by a small minority of voters who elected someone to continually impose their political positions on the other 81 percent of us. Ron Paul: ' US Elections Are Rigged & Voting is Used to Pacify the Public ' Of course, as is the case with Democrats looking to assign blame for Hillary\u2019s loss, pundits and political pontificators argue the people who didn\u2019t vote have no right to complain about the outcome. After all, a non-vote or a vote for a third-party candidate was, in actuality, a vote for Trump. But that logic is flawed. The majority of Americans don\u2019t vote anymore because the political system no longer represents them . We\u2019ve been disenfranchised by decades of corrupt, unrepresentative politicians.The United States, according to a highly-cited academic study, is effectively an oligarchy \u201celected\u201d by a minority of voters ruled by a smaller minority of disliked politicians who represent an even smaller minority of billionaires and special interests. You know it, I know it, hell, even former U.S. President Jimmy Carter knows it . The majority of Americans voted for nobody not because they don\u2019t care or because they are apathetic \u2014 they voted no confidence in a political system that forgot about them a long time ago.

    "title_en": "Another Black Swan Hits the U.S. Presidential Election",
    "body_en": "at 1:43 pm 3 Comments \r\nBy now, everyone on planet earth has heard about the bombshell news just announced by the FBI that it was re-opening its investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s private email server. Here\u2019s the text of FBI head James Comey\u2019s letter to Congressional leaders. \r\nObviously, lots of people are out there pontificating on what, if anything, this means. As such, I\u2019m going to add my two cents to the conversation. \r\nI\u2019ve prided myself on unemotionally calling this election how I see it the whole time, because I\u2019m neither a Hillary Clinton nor Donald Trump supporter. Being free of the tremendous baggage that comes with cheerleading a particular candidate in this contentious election, I had consistently predicted a Trump victory until the Access Hollywood tape emerged. At that point I penned a thought-piece titled, Donald Trump is in Trouble \u2013 Part 2 , in which I changed my forecast to a Hillary Clinton victory. \r\nHere\u2019s some of what I wrote: \r\nAfter watching yesterday\u2019s audio and reading through the Wikileaks revelations, my prediction has changed for the first time this election. All things equal from here on out (meaning no additional huge revelations against Hillary), I think Hillary Clinton will defeat Donald Trump. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be a landslide, but I think she\u2019s probably going to win. The audio was very harmful for Donald Trump, and now I\u2019m going to explain why. \r\nFirst of all, if you want to accurately forecast the outcome of this election you need to get into the minds of the masses. Just like trading financial markets, what you think is right doesn\u2019t matter. What matters is what everyone else collectively thinks, and whether or not they\u2019re going to get off their asses and vote. A big part of why I thought Trump would win related to the fact that I believe many people were simply looking for an excuse to vote for him. Justified disgust with the status quo in general, and Hillary Clinton in particular, pushed millions of Americans into the camp of being willing to take a gamble on Trump despite disliking him personally and disagreeing with him on many issues. I felt strongly that there were millions upon millions of Americans you could place into this category \u2014 people who were \u201cflirting with the idea of voting Trump.\u201d I believe a significant amount of these people will not vote for him as a result of the audio. Will it be the majority of them? Probably not, but it will be a material number and arguably enough to swing the election. No, I don\u2019t think these voters will shift to Hillary, and no, I don\u2019t think committed Trump voters will change their minds. However, I do think enough of these willing to be convinced, leaning-Trump types will now stay home or vote third party. It\u2019s these voters who I expected to swing the election in Trump\u2019s favor, and they are now unreliable. \r\nDoes Trump\u2019s vulgarity excuse the incalculable crimes of Hillary Clinton and her husband, making them preferable in this election? No it doesn\u2019t, but that\u2019s not the point of this article. Most voters are too superficial, too busy trying to survive and too uninformed to weigh all the very important issues rationally. As an example, think about how most conversations are going to go down this weekend. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re out with a bunch of friends for drinks tonight. Someone says, \u201cso have you seen the Trump audio?\u201d If someone in the group hasn\u2019t, someone will pull out their phone and it\u2019ll be watched in 3 minutes. What if someone then says, \u201cyeah, but have you seen the leaked Hillary emails?\u201d What will your response be? You can\u2019t adequately explain the importance of that to your friends in 3 minutes. Instead, you\u2019ll have to send them a lengthy article that they\u2019ll never read. So by the end of this weekend, pretty much everyone in America will have heard the Trump audio, while maybe 10% will take the time to analyze what came out of Wikileaks. There goes your election. \r\nUnderstanding the craziness of the election, I finished the piece with the following. \r\nDespite all of that, I still can\u2019t say with certainty that Hillary will win. However, I do think the landscape has changed enough, that for the first time this entire election season, I am no longer confident of a Trump victory. Then again, I was absolutely convinced that Hillary was unelectable after she collapsed on 9/11 and mislead everyone about her health, and I was wrong about that. That\u2019s how completely crazy this election is, and there\u2019s still a month to go. Anything can happen, particularly with the debate coming up this Sunday. So while it\u2019s certainly not out of the question, there will have to be some very material events over the next month to put Trump back in the driver\u2019s seat. \r\nWhile the Wikileaks emails have been an important factor in keeping this race close, I didn\u2019t think they were sufficient to alter my forecast of a Clinton victory. I think the reopening of the FBI investigation is enough of a black swan to materially change the course of this race. \r\nClinton supporters will read this and think I\u2019m insane. They will think this because they are anticipating a landslide victory for Hillary. I never expected a landslide, so I think this news tips the election into a total tossup situation. My reasoning for the change is the same that led me to switch my forecast to Hillary after the Access Hollywood video was released. The primary reason I initially thought Trump would win related to the fact I believed enough people would be willing to vote for a person they don\u2019t really like in order to blow up the status quo. I felt that the video recording of Trump\u2019s vulgar commentary was enough to put those people into the absentee or third party column, despite millions of Americans looking for an excuse to vote for Trump due to the well understood awfulness of Hillary. This has changed, and voters now have the excuse they needed to vote Trump. \r\nThat reason is simple. The problems with Hillary Clinton will never go away. They will always resurface or new problems will emerge, and it has nothing to do with a \u201cvast rightwing conspiracy\u201d (or Putin). It has to do with her. It has to do with the fact that her and her husband are career crooks, warmongers, and shameless looters of the American public. This re-opening of the FBI investigation just hammers all of that home for everyone. We know what 4 years of Hillary will look like. It\u2019ll be Obama cronyism on steroids, plus endless investigations with a side of World War 3. I don\u2019t think people want that, and so more Americans than the pundits realize will take a gamble on Trump. \r\nAs a caveat, the above forecast assumes this new FBI investigation is not closed before November 8th. If it is, I think she\u2019ll win. If not, I think Trump has even odds to win, if not better. \r\nOf course, with 11 days left in this crazy election, many more black swans could emerge. Stay tuned. \r\nIn Liberty,",

    "title_en": "US Presidential Elections Sound a Warning of Catastrophes to Come",
    "body_en": "US Presidential Elections Sound a Warning of Catastrophes to Come By Daily Bell Staff - November 08, 2016 \r\nWhat\u2019s wrong with Hillary Clinton\u2019s brand? \u2026 As momentous an occasion as this should be for women around the world, Ms. Clinton would begin her term in the Oval Office with her unpopularity ratings at near-record levels. All of which leads to the question: What\u2019s wrong with Brand Hillary? \u2013 The Globe and Mail \r\nIn the run-up to today\u2019s election, many articles on Hillary in the mainstream media have tried to explain more fully why Hillary is electable and desirable as the leader of the US. \r\nA common theme of these articles is that Hillary\u2019s troubles are not mentioned or analyzed in detail. The Economist magazine, like many other publications, recently came out with an endorsement of Hillary. \r\nBut the endorsement simply dealt with Hillary\u2019s legislative and professional history. As always when it comes to Hillary in the mainstream media, deeper questions are glossed over. \r\nThis approach to covering Hillary is deliberate and has generated increasing skepticism among large portions of the American public. Correctly, alternative media reports have pointed out this declining credibility but not enough have explained its widening ramifications. \r\nMore: \r\nMs. Clinton is one of the most qualified presidential candidates in recent memory \u2013 and her credentials are that much more impressive compared to those of her opponent. \r\nAfter her time as first lady \u2013 in the state of Arkansas, and in the White House \u2013 Ms. Clinton served her country as a U.S. Senator and as secretary of state. \r\nThe article goes on to ask why Hillary has not been \u201cable to break through in a way that inspires fervent support and popularity.\u201d \r\nAt this point a significant analysis would grapple with underlying issues regarding Hillary\u2019s background and approach to politics and life. These issues are well known. But instead, these issues are presented as \u201cmultiple scandals, ranging from Lewinsky to Benghazi, and most recently, her e-mails.\u201d \r\nThe use of the word \u201cscandal\u201d implies something embarrassing. The significance of these problems in her personal and professional life goes far beyond embarrassment. It illustrates her approach to the US political system and generally how she wields power. \r\nHaving skipped past this analysis, the article then minimizes the scandals themselves, stating, \u201dAny politician who has been in the game that long has their fair share of scandal.\u201d \r\nThe article continues to evolve toward ephemera, suggesting that a big problem with Ms. Clinton is her inability to \u201cappear likable to voters.\u201d This is a political problem to be sure, but it is not the UNDERLYING problem, which is much more significant. \r\nFinally, the article brings up the idea that a big reason for the disconnect between Hillary and voters has to do with her gender. \u201cAs disheartening as that still is, society and the media still stereotype women and paint them with a negative brush.\u201d \r\nThe article explains that much criticism of Hillary is gender-related. She has been scrutinized because of her health problems and has too-often been seen by the media as a wife and mother rather than as a businesslike politician with a long, professional history. \r\nAs stated, articles like this are at variance with what many believe to be true. Hillary is seen, at this point, by tens of millions as a person with an extremely shady past who may be part of a larger political mafia with her husband that deals in extortion, cover-ups, drug-dealing and even murder to generate vast profits for their Clinton Foundation, and thus for themselves. \r\nSince this information is so widely dispersed, articles that don\u2019t deal more directly with these issues can be seen either as painfully naive or as concealing something. It is one of the reasons that trust in the mainstream media has plunged so precipitously. \r\nAdditionally, as we pointed out recently, belief in \u201cconspiracy theories,\u201d has risen to over 50 percent. Hillary\u2019s campaign and its coverage may be directly responsible. Once people were increasingly and regularly exposed to the disconnect between what they believed about Hillary and what was being presented, they began to reexamine various \u201cconspiracy\u201d reports they\u2019d previously discounted. \r\nEven among those voting for Hillary, there is widespread sentiment that she may have committed criminal wrongdoings and deserves a trial rather than the presidency. \r\nWe\u2019ve advanced the idea that none of this has come about by accident, not the FBI fumblings, nor reports of her healthcare problems, nor even the email \u201cscandals.\u201d All of this in fact was known well in advance of her latest presidential run. \r\nThis is simply not a coincidence in our view. The idea, increasingly it seems, is to shatter cultural cohesion in the West with an eye toward creating increased globalization and an internationalized society. This presidential election and its mainstream coverage has done just that. \r\nGoing forward, it is probable that cultural destruction will be increasingly significant throughout the West, employing numerous strategies \u2013 political, ethnic, economic and military. \r\nThese elections \u2013 whether Hillary wins or Trump \u2013 are evidently the starting gun, along with the European immigrant crisis, for a new series of elite programs. These will likely yield up serial catastrophes that will change lives and belief structures going forward for millions and even billions \r\nConclusion: Building an international world, whether the effort is to be successful or not, is a massive and horribly disruptive and bloody prospect. Americans would be wise to perceive this latest presidential elections as a kind of warning of what it is to come.",

    "title_en": "Now That the Presidential-Election Side Show Is Finally Ending\u2026",
    "body_en": "Posted on November 8, 2016 by Charles Hugh Smith \r\nThough it has been billed as the main event for months, the presidential election has always been a side show \u2013or from one point of view, a freak show. \r\nAs I write this on Monday, I have no idea who will win the side show unpopularity contest (i.e. the presidential race)\u2013and it doesn\u2019t really matter as much as apoplectic partisans would have us believe. \r\nThe reason why it doesn\u2019t matter much which unpopular candidate wins is the issues facing the nation are far larger than partisan politics or the corrupt Ruling Elite that is freaking out about the possibility of a Trump presidency disrupting its self-serving skims and scams. \r\nAs I described yesterday in America\u2019s Ruling Elite Has Failed and Deserves to Be Fired ,we are in the midst of a fast-moving Industrial-Digital Revolution that is upending the political, economic and social orders. The global economy\u2019s current mode of production is in fits and starts being replaced with a new mode of production that bypasses the Ruling Elite\u2019s centralized skims and scams. \r\nReal reform is impossible in the current Status Quo , a dynamic I described in my book Why Our Status Quo Failed and Is Beyond Reform and illustrated with this chart. \r\nThe Ruling Elite will never allow real reform because real reform threatens their dominance and wealth. Instead, the Ruling Elite proposes modest policy tweaks that increase their dominance by limiting innovation and competition and transferring the systemic risks and costs of their skims/scams to the non-elites. \r\nIf a crisis does threaten their dominance, any meaningful reforms that result from the crisis will be watered down once the storm has passed. \r\nThe core problem is the Status Quo and its Ruling Elite rely on centralized hierarchies, regulatory capture and mobile capital to protect their dominance from innovation and competition. This aligned perfectly with the centralized World War II-era state-cartel/ central-bank mode of production that has dominated the economy and society since 1945. \r\nBut the Industrial-Digital Revolution is destabilizing these inflexible, centralized hierarchies which cannot compete with decentralized, flexible networks in output, efficiency or cost. \r\nThis presents the self-serving Ruling Elites with an impossible choice: either embrace the Industrial-Digital Revolution\u2019s efficiencies and watch the foundation of their own dominance and wealth crumble, or defend their bloated, inefficient and increasingly bankrupt centralized hierarchies from innovation and competition\u2013a war they are losing and cannot possibly win. \r\nThe Status Quo is not just financially bankrupt\u2013it is morally and intellectually bankrupt as well. The level of insider dealing, self-aggrandizement, collusion and corruption in the Ruling Elite is off the charts, and this is now visible for all to see. \r\nThe Status Quo\u2019s intellectual grab-bag of narratives and ideologies is devoid of anything remotely aligned with the Industrial-Digital Revolution. The Status Quo\u2019s intellectual grab-bag consists of 70-year old cults (the Keynesian Cargo Cult of Paul Krugman et al.) that have visibly failed and tired throwbacks to 1950: if only corporations weren\u2019t global, and if only capital wasn\u2019t mobile and if only the central state taxed us even more and borrowed and spent more\u2026 \r\nThese 1945 ideas cannot possibly succeed in the Industrial-Digital Revolution\u2019s mode of production . But both political parties, the Ruling Elites and the Establishment they dominate have no idea of how to manage this radically transformative mode of production . They are a clueless herd trampling the non-elites as they rush headlong over the cliff. \r\n(I cover this emerging economy in The Nearly Free University and the Emerging Economy and Get a Job, Build a Real Career and Defy a Bewildering Economy , and sketch a new systemic approach in A Radically Beneficial World: Automation, Technology & Creating Jobs for All .) \r\nNo leader can stop the emergence of a new mode of production . All they can do is engineer a crash by clinging to the expiring mode of production . The leadership of the U.S. sees only one path: further centralization that increases the power of the central state-bank-cartel mode of production . This is the road to ruin, akin to protecting the buggy-whip industry and the Whig Party at all costs. \r\nPoliticians aren\u2019t actually leaders. All they can do is give voice to what the people are willing to support, resist needed transformation by supporting a corrupt, sclerotic status quo or introduce the people to a new narrative. \r\nSadly, our self-serving Ruling Elite is only capable of resisting needed transformation by supporting a corrupt, sclerotic status quo. A new leadership class that actually understands the new mode of production may eventually emerge, but only after the corrupt, sclerotic status quo has deservedly collapsed under its own weight.",
